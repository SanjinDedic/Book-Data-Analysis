    " ONE\n\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED\n\nMr and Mrs Dursley of number four Privet Drive were proud to say\nthat they were perfectly normal thank you very much They were the last\npeople youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious\nbecause they just didnt hold with such nonsense\n\nMr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings which made\ndrills He was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did\nhave a very large mustache Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she\nspent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the\nneighbors The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their\nopinion there was no finer boy anywhere\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it They didnt\nthink they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters Mrs\nPotter was Mrs Dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years\nin fact Mrs Dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her\nsister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was\npossible to be The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street The Dursleys knew that the\nPotters had a small son too but they had never even seen him This boy\nwas another good reason for keeping the Potters away they didnt want\nDudley mixing with a child like that\n\nWhen Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull gray Tuesday our story\nstarts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\nstrange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the\ncountry Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for\nwork and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming\nDudley into his high chair\n\nNone of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window\n\nAt half past eight Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase pecked Mrs\nDursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed\nbecause Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the\nwalls Little tyke chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house He got\ninto his car and backed out of number fours drive\n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\nsomething peculiar    a cat reading a map For a second Mr Dursley\ndidnt realize what he had seen    then he jerked his head around to\nlook again There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet\nDrive but there wasnt a map in sight What could he have been thinking\nof It must have been a trick of the light Mr Dursley blinked and\nstared at the cat It stared back As Mr Dursley drove around the\ncorner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror It was now\nreading the sign that said Privet Drive    no looking at the sign cats\ncouldnt read maps or signs Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and\nput the cat out of his mind As he drove toward town he thought of\nnothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day\n\nBut on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something\nelse As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help\nnoticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\nabout People in cloaks Mr Dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in\nfunny clothes    the getups you saw on young people He supposed this\nwas some stupid new fashion He drummed his fingers on the steering\nwheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite\nclose by They were whispering excitedly together Mr Dursley was\nenraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man\nhad to be older than he was and wearing an emerald green cloak The\nnerve of him But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some\nsilly stunt    these people were obviously collecting for something\nyes that would be it The traffic moved on and a few minutes later Mr\nDursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills\n\nMr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\nninth floor If he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate\non drills that morning He didnt see the owls swoop ing past in broad\ndaylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed\nopen  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead Most of them had never\nseen an owl even at nighttime Mr Dursley however had a perfectly\nnormal owl free morning He yelled at five different people He made\nseveral important telephone calls and shouted a bit more He was in a\nvery good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs\nand walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery\n\nHed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\nthem next to the bakers He eyed them angrily as he passed He didnt\nknow why but they made him uneasy This bunch were whispering\nexcitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin It was on\nhis way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he\ncaught a few words of what they were saying\n\nThe Potters thats right thats what I heard yes their son Harry\n\nMr Dursley stopped dead Fear flooded him He looked back at the\nwhisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better\nof it\n\nHe dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his\nsecretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost\nfinished dialing his home number when he changed his mind He put the\nreceiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was\nbeing stupid Potter wasnt such an unusual name He was sure there were\nlots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry Come to think\nof it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called Harry Hed never even\nseen the boy It might have been Harvey Or Harold There was no point\nin worrying Mrs Dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her\nsister He didnt blame her    if hed had a sister like that but all\nthe same those people in cloaks\n\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and\nwhen he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that\nhe walked straight into someone just outside the door\n\nSorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell It\nwas a few seconds before Mr Dursley realized that the man was wearing a\nviolet cloak He didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the\nground On the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in\na squeaky voice that made passersby stare Dont be sorry my dear sir\nfor nothing could upset me today Rejoice for You Know Who has gone at\nlast Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy\nhappy day\n\nAnd the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and walked off\n\nMr Dursley stood rooted to the spot He had been hugged by a complete\nstranger He also thought he had been called a Muggle whatever that\nwas He was rattled He hurried to his car and set off for home hoping\nhe was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he\ndidnt approve of imagination\n\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw   \nand it didnt improve his mood    was the tabby cat hed spotted that\nmorning It was now sitting on his garden wall He was sure it was the\nsame one it had the same markings around its eyes\n\nShoo said Mr Dursley loudly The cat didnt move It just gave him a\nstern look Was this normal cat behavior Mr Dursley wondered Trying\nto pull himself together he let himself into the house He was still\ndetermined not to mention anything to his wife\n\nMrs Dursley had had a nice normal day She told him over dinner all\nabout Mrs Next Doors problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\nlearned a new word Wont Mr Dursley tried to act normally When\nDudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to\ncatch the last report on the evening news\n\nAnd finally bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nations\nowls have been behaving very unusually today Although owls normally\nhunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been\nhundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since\nsunrise Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly\nchanged their sleeping pattern The newscaster allowed himself a grin\nMost mysterious And now over to Jim McGuffin with the weather Going\nto be any more showers of owls tonight Jim\n\nWell Ted said the weatherman I dont know about that but its not\nonly the owls that have been acting oddly today Viewers as far apart as\nKent Yorkshire and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead\nof the rain I promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting\nstars Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early    its\nnot until next week folks But I can promise a wet night tonight\n\nMr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair Shooting stars all over Britain\nOwls flying by daylight Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place\nAnd a whisper a whisper about the Potters\n\nMrs Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea It was\nno good Hed have to say something to her He cleared his throat\nnervously Er    Petunia dear    you havent heard from your sister\nlately have you\n\nAs he had expected Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry After all\nthey normally pretended she didnt have a sister\n\nNo she said sharply Why\n\nFunny stuff on the news Mr Dursley mumbled Owls shooting\nstars and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today\n\nSo snapped Mrs Dursley\n\nWell I just thought maybe it was something to do with you\nknow her crowd\n\nMrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips Mr Dursley wondered\nwhether he dared tell her hed heard the name Potter He decided he\ndidnt dare Instead he said as casually as he could Their son   \nhed be about Dudleys age now wouldnt he\n\nI suppose so said Mrs Dursley stiffly\n\nWhats his name again Howard isnt it\n\nHarry Nasty common name if you ask me\n\nOh yes said Mr Dursley his heart sinking horribly Yes I quite\nagree\n\nHe didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed\nWhile Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom\nwindow and peered down into the front garden The cat was still there\nIt was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for\nsomething\n\nWas he imagining things Could all this have anything to do with the\nPotters If it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of\n   well he didnt think he could bear it\n\nThe Dursleys got into bed Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr\nDursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind His last comforting\nthought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were\ninvolved there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs\nDursley The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about\nthem and their kind He couldnt see how he and Petunia could get\nmixed up in anything that might be going on    he yawned and turned over\n   it couldnt affect them\n\nHow very wrong he was\n\nMr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat\non the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness It was sitting as\nstill as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of\nPrivet Drive It didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the\nnext street nor when two owls swooped overhead In fact it was nearly\nmidnight before the cat moved at all\n\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so\nsuddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the\nground The cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowed\n\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive He was tall\nthin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which\nwere both long enough to tuck into his belt He was wearing long robes\na purple cloak that swept the ground and high heeled buckled boots\nHis blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind half moon\nspectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been\nbroken at least twice This mans name was Albus Dumbledore\n\nAlbus Dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\nstreet where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome He was\nbusy rummaging in his cloak looking for something But he did seem to\nrealize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat\nwhich was still staring at him from the other end of the street For\nsome reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him He chuckled and\nmuttered I should have known\n\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket It seemed to be a\nsilver cigarette lighter He flicked it open held it up in the air and\nclicked it The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop He\nclicked it again    the next lamp flickered into darkness Twelve times\nhe clicked the Put Outer until the only lights left on the whole street\nwere two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat\nwatching him If anyone looked out of their window now even beady eyed\nMrs Dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening\ndown on the pavement Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his\ncloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down\non the wall next to the cat He didnt look at it but after a moment he\nspoke to it\n\nFancy seeing you here Professor McGonagall\n\nHe turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone Instead he was smiling\nat a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly\nthe shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes She too was\nwearing a cloak an emerald one Her black hair was drawn into a tight\nbun She looked distinctly ruffled\n\nHow did you know it was me she asked\n\nMy dear Professor I ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly\n\nYoud be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day said\nProfessor McGonagall\n\nAll day When you could have been celebrating I must have passed a\ndozen feasts and parties on my way here\n\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily\n\nOh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatiently\nYoud think theyd be a bit more careful but no    even the Muggles\nhave noticed somethings going on It was on their news She jerked her\nhead back at the Dursleys dark living room window I heard it Flocks\nof owls shooting stars Well theyre not completely stupid They\nwere bound to notice something Shooting stars down in Kent    Ill bet\nthat was Dedalus Diggle He never had much sense\n\nYou cant blame them said Dumbledore gently Weve had precious\nlittle to celebrate for eleven years\n\nI know that said Professor McGonagall irritably But thats no\nreason to lose our heads People are being downright careless out on\nthe streets in broad daylight not even dressed in Muggle clothes\nswapping rumors\n\nShe threw a sharp sideways glance at Dumbledore here as though hoping\nhe was going to tell her something but he didnt so she went on A\nfine thing it would be if on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have\ndisappeared at last the Muggles found out about us all I suppose he\nreally has gone Dumbledore\n\nIt certainly seems so said Dumbledore We have much to be thankful\nfor Would you care for a lemon drop\n\nA what\n\nA lemon drop Theyre a kind of Muggle sweet Im rather fond of\n\nNo thank you said Professor McGonagall coldly as though she didnt\nthink this was the moment for lemon drops As I say even if\nYou Know Who has gone  \n\nMy dear Professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him\nby his name All this You  Know Who nonsense    for eleven years I\nhave been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name\nVoldemort Professor McGonagall flinched but Dumbledore who was\nunsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice It all gets so\nconfusing if we keep saying You Know Who I have never seen any reason\nto be frightened of saying Voldemorts name\n\nI know you haven t said Professor McGonagall sounding half\nexasperated half admiring But youre different Everyone knows youre\nthe only one You Know  oh all right Voldemort was frightened of\n\nYou flatter me said Dumbledore calmly Voldemort had powers I will\nnever have\n\nOnly because youre too    well    noble to use them\n\nIts lucky its dark I havent blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\ntold me she liked my new earmuffs\n\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said The owls\nare nothing next to the rumors that are flying around You know what\neveryones saying About why hes disappeared About what finally\nstopped him\n\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most\nanxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard\nwall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed\nDumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now It was plain that\nwhatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until\nDumbledore told her it was true Dumbledore however was choosing\nanother lemon drop and did not answer\n\nWhat theyre saying she pressed on is that last night Voldemort\nturned up in Godrics Hollow He went to find the Potters The rumor is\nthat Lily and James Potter are    are    that theyre    dead \n\nDumbledore bowed his head Professor McGonagall gasped\n\nLily and James I cant believe it I didnt want to believe it\nOh Albus\n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder I know I\nknow he said heavily\n\nProfessor McGonagalls voice trembled as she went on Thats not all\nTheyre saying he tried to kill the Potters son Harry But    he\ncouldnt He couldnt kill that little boy No one knows why or how\nbut theyre saying that when he couldnt kill Harry Potter Voldemorts\npower somehow broke    and thats why hes gone\n\nDumbledore nodded glumly\n\nIts    its true faltered Professor McGonagall After all hes\ndone all the people hes killed he couldnt kill a little boy\nIts just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the\nname of heaven did Harry survive\n\nWe can only guess said Dumbledore We may never know\n\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her\neyes beneath her spectacles Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a\ngolden watch from his pocket and examined it It was a very odd watch\nIt had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving\naround the edge It must have made sense to Dumbledore though because\nhe put it back in his pocket and said Hagrids late I suppose it was\nhe who told you Id be here by the way\n\nYes said Professor McGonagall And I dont suppose youre going to\ntell me why youre here of all places\n\nIve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle Theyre the only family\nhe has left now\n\nYou dont mean    you cant mean the people who live here cried\nProfessor McGonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four\nDumbledore    you cant Ive been watching them all day You couldnt\nfind two people who are less like us And theyve got this son    I saw\nhim kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets\nHarry Potter come and live here\n\nIts the best place for him said Dumbledore firmly His aunt and\nuncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older Ive\nwritten them a letter\n\nA letter repeated Professor McGonagall faintly sitting back down on\nthe wall Really Dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a\nletter These people will never understand him Hell be famous    a\nlegend    I wouldnt be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day\nin the future    there will be books written about Harry    every child\nin our world will know his name\n\nExactly said Dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his\nhalf moon glasses It would be enough to turn any boys head Famous\nbefore he can walk and talk Famous for something he wont even\nremember CarA you see how much better off hell be growing up away\nfrom all that until hes ready to take it\n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and\nthen said Yes    yes youre right of course But how is the boy\ngetting here Dumbledore She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she\nthought he might be hiding Harry underneath it\n\nHagrids bringing him\n\nYou think it    wise    to trust Hagrid with something as important as\nthis\n\nI would trust Hagrid with my life said Dumbledore\n\nIm not saying his heart isnt in the right place said Professor\nMcGonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless He does\ntend to    what was that\n\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them It grew\nsteadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a\nheadlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky    and\na huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of\nthem\n\nIf the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride\nit He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times\nas wide He looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild   long\ntangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands\nthe size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were\nlike baby dolphins In his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle\nof blankets\n\nHagrid said Dumbledore sounding relieved At last And where did\nyou get that motorcycle\n\nBorrowed it Professor Dumbledore sit said the giant climbing\ncarefully off the motorcycle as he spoke Young Sirius Black lent it to\nme Ive got him sir\n\nNo problems were there\n\nNo sir    house was almost destroyed but I got him out all right\nbefore the Muggles started swarmin around He fell asleep as we was\nflyin over Bristol\n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of\nblankets Inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep Under a\ntuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously\nshaped cut like a bolt of lightning\n\nIs that where   whispered Professor McGonagall\n\nYes said Dumbledore Hell have that scar forever\n\nCouldnt you do something about it Dumbledore\n\nEven if I could I wouldnt Scars can come in handy I have one myself\nabove my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground Well\n   give him here Hagrid    wed better get this over with\n\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys house\n\nCould I    could I say good bye to him sir asked Hagrid He bent his\ngreat shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very\nscratchy whiskery kiss Then suddenly Hagrid let out a howl like a\nwounded dog\n\nShhh hissed Professor McGonagall youll wake the Muggles\n\nS s sorry sobbed Hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and\nburying his face in it But I c c cant stand it    Lily an James dead\n   an poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles  \n\nYes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself Hagrid or\nwell be found Professor McGonagall whispered patting Hagrid gingerly\non the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to\nthe front door He laid Harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out\nof his cloak tucked it inside Harrys blankets and then came back to\nthe other two For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at\nthe little bundle Hagrids shoulders shook Professor McGonagall\nblinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from\nDumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out\n\nWell said Dumbledore finally thats that Weve no business staying\nhere We may as well go and join the celebrations\n\nYeah said Hagrid in a very muffled voice Ill be takin Sirius his\nbike back Gnight Professor McGonagall    Professor Dumbledore sir\n\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve Hagrid swung himself\nonto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose\ninto the air and off into the night\n\nI shall see you soon I expect Professor McGonagall said Dumbledore\nnodding to her Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply\n\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street On the corner he\nstopped and took out the silver Put Outer He clicked it once and\ntwelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet\nDrive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking\naround the corner at the other end of the street He could just see the\nbundle of blankets on the step of number four\n\nGood luck Harry he murmured He turned on his heel and with a swish\nof his cloak he was gone\n\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive which lay silent and\ntidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect\nastonishing things to happen Harry Potter rolled over inside his\nblankets without waking up One small hand closed on the letter beside\nhim and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was\nfamous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by Mrs\nDursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk\nbottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and\npinched by his cousin Dudley He couldnt know that at this very\nmoment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up\ntheir glasses and saying in hushed voices To Harry Potter    the boy\nwho lived\n\n\n",
    " TWO\n\nTHE VANISHING GLASS\n\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find\ntheir nephew on the front step but Privet Drive had hardly changed at\nall The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass\nnumber four on the Dursleys front door it crept into their living\nroom which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when\nMr Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls Only the\nphotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed\nTen years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\nlarge pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets    but Dudley\nDursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large\nblond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a\ncomputer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother\nThe room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too\n\nYet Harry Potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for\nlong His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made\nthe first noise of the day\n\nUp Get up Now\n\nHarry woke with a start His aunt rapped on the door again\n\nUp she screeched Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then\nthe sound of the frying pan being put on the stove He rolled onto his\nback and tried to remember the dream he had been having It had been a\ngood one There had been a flying motorcycle in it He had a funny\nfeeling hed had the same dream before\n\nHis aunt was back outside the door\n\nAre you up yet she demanded\n\nNearly said Harry\n\nWell get a move on I want you to look after the bacon And dont you\ndare let it burn I want everything perfect on Duddys birthday\n\nHarry groaned\n\nWhat did you say his aunt snapped through the door\n\nNothing nothing\n\nDudleys birthday    how could he have forgotten Harry got slowly out\nof bed and started looking for socks He found a pair under his bed and\nafter pulling a spider off one of them put them on Harry was used to\nspiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and\nthat was where he slept\n\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen The table\nwas almost hidden beneath all Dudleys birthday presents It looked as\nthough Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the\nsecond television and the racing bike Exactly why Dudley wanted a\nracing bike was a mystery to Harry as Dudley was very fat and hated\nexercise    unless of course it involved punching somebody Dudleys\nfavorite punching bag was Harry but he couldnt often catch him Harry\ndidnt look it but he was very fast\n\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but Harry\nhad always been small and skinny for his age He looked even smaller and\nskinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes\nof Dudleys and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was Harry\nhad a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes He\nwore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of\nall the times Dudley had punched him on the nose The only thing Harry\nliked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that\nwas shaped like a bolt of lightning He had had it as long as he could\nremember and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt\nPetunia was how he had gotten it\n\nIn the car crash when your parents died she had said And dont ask\nquestions\n\nDont ask questions    that was the first rule for a quiet life with the\nDursleys\n\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon\n\nComb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting\n\nAbout once a week Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and\nshouted that Harry needed a haircut Harry must have had more haircuts\nthan the rest of the boys in his class put\n\ntogether but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way   \nall over the place\n\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his\nmother Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon He had a large pink face\nnot much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay\nsmoothly on his thick fat head Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley\nlooked like a baby angel    Harry often said that Dudley looked like a\npig in a wig\n\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult\nas there wasnt much room Dudley meanwhile was counting his presents\nHis face fell\n\nThirty six he said looking up at his mother and father Thats two\nless than last year\n\nDarling you havent counted Auntie Marges present see its here\nunder this big one from Mommy and Daddy\n\nAll right thirty seven then said Dudley going red in the face\nHarry who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down\nhis bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over\n\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly\nAnd well buy you another two presents while were out today Hows\nthat popkin Two more presents Is that all right\n\nDudley thought for a moment It looked like hard work Finally he said\nslowly So Ill have thirty  thirty\n\nThirty nine sweetums said Aunt Petunia\n\nOh Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel All right\nthen\n\nUncle Vernon chuckled Little tyke wants his moneys worth just like\nhis father Atta boy Dudley He ruffled Dudleys hair\n\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it\nwhile Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike a\nvideo camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and\na VCR He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia\ncame back from the telephone looking both angry and worried\n\nBad news Vernon she said Mrs Figgs broken her leg She cant\ntake him She jerked her head in Harrys direction\n\nDudleys mouth fell open in horror but Harrys heart gave a leap Every\nyear on Dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the\nday to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies Every\nyear Harry was left behind with Mrs Figg a mad old lady who lived two\nstreets away Harry hated it there The whole house smelled of cabbage\nand Mrs Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever\nowned\n\nNow what said Aunt Petunia looking furiously at Harry as though hed\nplanned this Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs Figg had\nbroken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be\na whole year before he had to look at Tibbles Snowy Mr Paws and\nTufty again\n\nWe could phone Marge Uncle Vernon suggested\n\nDont be silly Vernon she hates the boy\n\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this as though he wasnt\nthere    or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt\nunderstand them like a slug\n\nWhat about whats her name your friend    Yvonne\n\nOn vacation in Majorca snapped Aunt Petunia\n\nYou could just leave me here Harry put in hopefully hed be able to\nwatch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go\non Dudleys computer\n\nAunt Petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemon\n\nAnd come back and find the house in ruins she snarled\n\nI wont blow up the house said Harry but they werent listening\n\nI suppose we could take him to the zoo said Aunt Petunia slowly \nand leave him in the car\n\nThat cars new hes not sitting in it alone\n\nDudley began to cry loudly In fact he wasnt really crying    it had\nbeen years since hed really cried    but he knew that if he screwed up\nhis face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted\n\nDinky Duddydums dont cry Mummy wont let him spoil your special\nday she cried flinging her arms around him\n\nI dont want him t t to come Dudley yelled between huge\npretend sobs He always sp  spoils everything He shot Harry a nasty\ngrin through the gap in his mothers arms\n\nJust then the doorbell rang    Oh good Lord theyre here said Aunt\nPetunia frantically    and a moment later Dudleys best friend Piers\nPolkiss walked in with his mother Piers was a scrawny boy with a face\nlike a rat He was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their\nbacks while Dudley hit them Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once\n\nHalf an hour later Harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in\nthe back of the Dursleys car with Piers and Dudley on the way to the\nzoo for the first time in his life His aunt and uncle hadnt been able\nto think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left Uncle\nVernon had taken Harry aside\n\nIm warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up\nclose to Harrys Im warning you now boy    any funny business\nanything at all    and youll be in that cupboard from now until\nChristmas\n\nIm not going to do anything said Harry honestly\n\nBut Uncle Vernon didnt believe him No one ever did\n\nThe problem was strange things often happened around Harry and it was\njust no good telling the Dursleys he didnt make them happen\n\nOnce Aunt Petunia tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking\nas though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors\nand cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which\nshe left to hide that horrible scar Dudley had laughed himself silly\nat Harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day\nwhere he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses\nNext morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it\nhad been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week\nin his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he\ncouldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly\n\nAnother time Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting\nold sweater of Dudleys brown with orange puff balls    The harder she\ntried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until\nfinally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit\nHarry Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to\nhis great relief Harry wasnt punished\n\nOn the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on\nthe roof of the school kitchens Dudleys gang had been chasing him as\nusual when as much to Harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was\nsitting on the chimney The Dursleys had received a very angry letter\nfrom Harrys headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school\nbuildings But all hed tried to do as he shouted at Uncle Vernon\nthrough the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash\ncans outside the kitchen doors Harry supposed that the wind must have\ncaught him in mid  jump\n\nBut today nothing was going to go wrong It was even worth being with\nDudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school\nhis cupboard or Mrs Figgs cabbage smelling living room\n\nWhile he drove Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia He liked to\ncomplain about things people at work Harry the council Harry the\nbank and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects This morning\nit was motorcycles\n\n roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a\nmotorcycle overtook them\n\nI had a dream about a motorcycle said Harry remembering suddenly It\nwas flying\n\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front He turned right\naround in his seat and yelled at Harry his face like a gigantic beet\nwith a mustache MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY\n\nDudley and Piers sniggered\n\nI know they dont said Harry It was only a dream\n\nBut he wished he hadnt said anything If there was one thing the\nDursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking\nabout anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a\ndream or even a cartoon    they seemed to think he might get dangerous\nideas\n\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families The\nDursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the\nentrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry\nwhat he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap\nlemon ice pop It wasnt bad either Harry thought licking it as they\nwatched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley\nexcept that it wasnt blond\n\nHarry had the best morning hed had in a long time He was careful to\nwalk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers who\nwere starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall\nback on their favorite hobby of hitting him They ate in the zoo\nrestaurant and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker\nglory didnt have enough ice cream on top Uncle Vernon bought him\nanother one and Harry was allowed to finish the first\n\nHarry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to\nlast\n\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house It was cool and dark in\nthere with lit windows all along the walls Behind the glass all sorts\nof lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and\nstone Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick\nman crushing pythons Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the\nplace It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernons car\nand crushed it into a trash can    but at the moment it didnt look in\nthe mood In fact it was fast asleep\n\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the\nglistening brown coils\n\nMake it move he whined at his father Uncle Vernon tapped on the\nglass but the snake didnt budge\n\nDo it again Dudley ordered Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly\nwith his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on\n\nThis is boring Dudley moaned He shuffled away\n\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake He\nwouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself    no\ncompany except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying\nto disturb it all day long It was worse than having a cupboard as a\nbedroom where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door\nto wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house\n\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes Slowly very slowly it raised\nits head until its eyes were on a level with Harrys\n\nIt winked\n\nHarry stared Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was\nwatching They werent He looked back at the snake and winked too\n\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley then raised\nits eyes to the ceiling It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly\n\nI get that all the time\n\nI know Harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the\nsnake could hear him It must be really annoying\n\nThe snake nodded vigorously\n\nWhere do you come from anyway Harry asked\n\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass Harry\npeered at it\n\nBoa Constrictor Brazil\n\nWas it nice there\n\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on\nThis specimen was bred in the zoo Oh I see    so youve never been to\nBrazil\n\nAs the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind Harry made both of\nthem jump\n\nDUDLEY MR DURSLEY COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE YOU WONT BELIEVE\nWHAT ITS DOING\n\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could\n\nOut of the way you he said punching Harry in the ribs Caught by\nsurprise Harry fell hard on the concrete floor What came next happened\nso fast no one saw how it happened    one second Piers and Dudley were\nleaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with\nhowls of horror\n\nHarry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictors tank\nhad vanished The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering\nout onto the floor People throughout the reptile house screamed and\nstarted running for the exits\n\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him Harry could have sworn a low\nhissing voice said Brazil here I come Thanksss amigo\n\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock\n\nBut the glass he kept saying where did the glass go\n\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong sweet tea\nwhile he apologized over and over again Piers and Dudley could only\ngibber As far as Harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything except\nsnap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were\nall back in Uncle Vernons car Dudley was telling them how it had\nnearly bitten off his leg while Piers was swearing it had tried to\nsqueeze him to death But worst of all for Harry at least was Piers\ncalming down enough to say Harry was talking to it werent you\nHarry\n\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before\nstarting on Harry He was so angry he could hardly speak He managed to\nsay Go    cupboard    stay    no meals before he collapsed into a\nchair and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy\n\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch He\ndidnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the Dursleys were\nasleep yet Until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen\nfor some food\n\nHed lived with the Dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as\nlong as he could remember ever since hed been a baby and his parents\nhad died in that car crash He couldnt remember being in the car when\nhis parents had died Sometimes when he strained his memory during long\nhours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding\nflash of green light and a burn  ing pain on his forehead This he\nsupposed was the crash though he couldnt imagine where all the green\nlight came from He couldnt remember his parents at all His aunt and\nuncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask\nquestions There were no photographs of them in the house\n\nWhen he had been younger Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown\nrelation coming to take him away but it had never happened the\nDursleys were his only family Yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped\nthat strangers in the street seemed to know him Very strange strangers\nthey were too A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once\nwhile out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley After asking Harry\nfuriously if he knew the man Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the\nshop without buying anything A wild looking old woman dressed all in\ngreen had waved merrily at him once on a bus A bald man in a very long\npurple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and\nthen walked away without a word The weirdest thing about all these\npeople was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a\ncloser look\n\nAt school Harry had no one Everybody knew that Dudleys gang hated\nthat odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and\nnobody liked to disagree with Dudleys gang\n\n\n",
    " THREE\n\nTHE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his\nlongest ever punishment By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard\nagain the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his\nnew video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time\nout on his racing bike knocked down old Mrs Figg as she crossed Privet\nDrive on her crutches\n\nHarry was glad school was over but there was no escaping Dudleys gang\nwho visited the house every single day Piers Dennis Malcolm and\nGordon were all big and stupid but as Dudley was the biggest and\nstupidest of the lot he was the leader The rest of them were all quite\nhappy to join in Dudleys favorite sport Harry Hunting\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he\ncould see a tiny ray of hope When September came he would be going off\nto secondary school and for the first time in his life he wouldnt be\nwith Dudley Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernons old private\nschool Smeltings Piers Polkiss was going there too Harry on the\nother hand was going to Stonewall High the local public school Dudley\nthought this was very funny\n\nThey stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall\nhe told Harry Want to come upstairs and practice\n\nNo thanks said Harry The poor toilets never had anything as\nhorrible as your head down it    it might be sick Then he ran before\nDudley could work out what hed said\n\nOne day in July Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings\nuniform leaving Harry at Mrs Figgs Mrs Figg wasn t as bad as\nusual It turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats\nand she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before She let Harry watch\ntelevision and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though\nshed had it for several years\n\nThat evening Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in\nhis brand new uniform Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange\nknickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters They also carried\nknobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers werent\nlooking This was supposed to be good training for later life\n\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers Uncle Vernon said\ngruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life Aunt Petunia burst\ninto tears and said she couldnt believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins he\nlooked so handsome and grown up Harry didnt trust himself to speak He\nthought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to\nlaugh\n\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry\nwent in for breakfast It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in\nthe sink He went to have a look The tub was full of what looked like\ndirty rags swimming in gray water\n\nWhats this he asked Aunt Petunia Her lips tightened as they always\ndid if he dared to ask a question\n\nYour new school uniform she said\n\nHarry looked in the bowl again\n\nOh he said I didnt realize it had to be so wet\n\nDotA be stupid snapped Aunt Petunia Im dyeing some of Dudleys old\nthings gray for you Itll look just like everyone elses when Ive\nfinished\n\nHarry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue He sat\ndown at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look\non his first day at Stonewall High    like he was wearing bits of old\nelephant skin probably\n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the\nsmell from Harrys new uniform Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as\nusual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick which he carried everywhere\non the table\n\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the\ndoormat\n\nGet the mail Dudley said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper\n\nMake Harry get it\n\nGet the mail Harry\n\nMake Dudley get it\n\nPoke him with your Smelting stick Dudley\n\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail Three things\nlay on the doormat a postcard from Uncle Vernons sister Marge who was\nvacationing on the Isle of Wight a brown envelope that looked like a\nbill and    a letter for Harry\n\nHarry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant\nelastic band No one ever in his whole life had written to him Who\nwould He had no friends no other relatives    he didnt belong to the\nlibrary so hed never even got rude notes asking for books back Yet\nhere it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake\n\nMr H Potter\n\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\n\n4 Privet Drive\n\nLittle Whinging\n\nSurrey\n\nThe envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the\naddress was written in emerald green ink There was no stamp\n\nTurning the envelope over his hand trembling Harry saw a purple wax\nseal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake\nsurrounding a large letter H\n\nHurry up boy shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen What are you\ndoing checking for letter bombs He chuckled at his own joke\n\nHarry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter He handed\nUncle Vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to\nopen the yellow envelope\n\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over\nthe postcard\n\nMarges ill he informed Aunt Petunia Ate a funny whelk   \n\nDad said Dudley suddenly Dad Harrys got something\n\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the\nsame heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of\nhis hand by Uncle Vernon\n\nThats mine said Harry trying to snatch it back\n\nWhod be writing to you sneered Uncle Vernon shaking the letter open\nwith one hand and glancing at it His face went from red to green faster\nthan a set of traffic lights And it didnt stop there Within seconds\nit was the grayish white of old porridge\n\nP P Petunia he gasped\n\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it but Uncle Vernon held it\nhigh out of his reach Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first\nline For a moment it looked as though she might faint She clutched her\nthroat and made a choking noise\n\nVernon Oh my goodness    Vernon\n\nThey stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\nDudley were still in the room Dudley wasnt used to being ignored He\ngave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick\n\nI want to read that letter he said loudly want to read it said\nHarry furiously as its mine\n\nGet out both of you croaked Uncle Vernon stuffing the letter back\ninside its envelope\n\nHarry didnt move\n\nI WANT MY LETTER he shouted\n\nLet me see it demanded Dudley\n\nOUT roared Uncle Vernon and he took both Harry and Dudley by the\nscruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the\nkitchen door behind them Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but\nsilent fight over who would listen at the keyhole Dudley won so Harry\nhis glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at\nthe crack between door and floor\n\nVernon Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the\naddress    how could they possibly know where he sleeps You dont think\ntheyre watching the house\n\nWatching    spying    might be following us muttered Uncle Vernon\nwildly\n\nBut what should we do Vernon Should we write back Tell them we dont\nwant   \n\nHarry could see Uncle Vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the\nkitchen\n\nNo he said finally No well ignore it If they dont get an\nanswer Yes thats best we wont do anything\n\nBut   \n\nIm not having one in the house Petunia Didnt we swear when we took\nhim in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsense\n\nThat evening when he got back from work Uncle Vernon did something hed\nnever done before he visited Harry in his cupboard\n\nWheres my letter said Harry the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed\nthrough the door Whos writing to me\n\nNo one it was addressed to you by mistake said Uncle Vernon shortly\nI have burned it\n\nIt was not a mistake said Harry angrily it had my cupboard on it\n\nSILENCE yelled Uncle Vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the\nceiling He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a\nsmile which looked quite painful\n\nEr    yes Harry    about this cupboard Your aunt and I have been\nthinking youre really getting a bit big for it we think it might\nbe nice if you moved into Dudleys second bedroom\n\nWhy said Harry\n\nDont ask questions snapped his uncle Take this stuff upstairs\nnow\n\nThe Dursleys house had four bedrooms one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt\nPetunia one for visitors usually Uncle Vernons sister Marge one\nwhere Dudley slept and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things\nthat wouldnt fit into his first bedroom It only took Harry one trip\nupstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room He\nsat down on the bed and stared around him Nearly everything in here was\nbroken The month old video camera was lying on top of a small working\ntank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbors dog in the\ncorner was Dudleys first ever television set which hed put his foot\nthrough when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large\nbirdcage which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school\nfor a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent\nbecause Dudley had sat on it Other shelves were full of books They\nwere the only things in the room that looked as though theyd never been\ntouched\n\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother I dont\nwant him in there I need that room make him get out\n\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed Yesterday hed have given\nanything to be up here Today hed rather be back in his cupboard with\nthat letter than up here without it\n\nNext morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet Dudley was in\nshock Hed screamed whacked his father with his Smelting stick been\nsick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the\ngreenhouse roof and he still didnt have his room back Harry was\nthinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing hed opened the\nletter in the hall Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each\nother darkly\n\nWhen the mail arrived Uncle Vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice\nto Harry made Dudley go and get it They heard him banging things with\nhis Smelting stick all the way down the hall Then he shouted Theres\nanother one Mr H Potter The Smallest Bedroom 4 Privet Drive   \n\nWith a strangled cry Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the\nhall Harry right behind him Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the\nground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact\nthat Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind After a\nminute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the\nSmelting stick Uncle Vernon straightened up gasping for breath with\nHarrys letter clutched in his hand\n\nGo to your cupboard    I mean your bedroom he wheezed at Harry\nDudley    go    just go\n\nHarry walked round and round his new room Someone knew he had moved out\nof his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnt received his first\nletter Surely that meant theyd try again And this time hed make sure\nthey didnt fail He had a plan\n\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next morning Harry\nturned it off quickly and dressed silently He mustnt wake the\nDursleys He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights\n\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and\nget the letters for number four first His heart hammered as he crept\nacross the dark hall toward the front door   \n\nHarry leapt into the air hed trodden on something big and squashy on\nthe doormat    something alive\n\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the\nbig squashy something had been his uncles face Uncle Vernon had been\nlying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making\nsure that Harry didnt do exactly what hed been trying to do He\nshouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make\na cup of tea Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the\ntime he got back the mail had arrived right into Uncle Vernons lap\nHarry could see three letters addressed in green ink\n\nI want    he began but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into\npieces before his eyes Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day He\nstayed at home and nailed up the mail slot\n\nSee he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails if\nthey cant deliver them theyll just give up\n\nIm not sure thatll work Vernon\n\nOh these peoples minds work in strange ways Petunia theyre not\nlike you and me said Uncle Vernon trying to knock in a nail with the\npiece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him\n\nOn Friday no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry As they\ncouldnt go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door\nslotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small\nwindow in the downstairs bathroom\n\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again After burning all the letters he got\nout a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and\nback doors so no one could go out He hummed Tiptoe Through the Tulips\nas he worked and jumped at small noises\n\nOn Saturday things began to get out of hand Twenty four letters to\nHarry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each\nof the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt\nPetunia through the living room window While Uncle Vernon made furious\ntelephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone\nto complain to Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor\n\nWho on earth wants to talk to you this badly Dudley asked Harry in\namazement\n\nOn Sunday morning Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking\ntired and rather ill but happy\n\nNo post on Sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade\non his newspapers no damn letters today   \n\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught\nhim sharply on the back of the head Next moment thirty or forty\nletters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets The Dursleys\nducked but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one\n\nOut OUT\n\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall\nWhen Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their\nfaces Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut They could hear the letters\nstill streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floor\n\nThat does it said Uncle Vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling\ngreat tufts out of his mustache at the same time I want you all back\nhere in five minutes ready to leave Were going away Just pack some\nclothes No arguments\n\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared\nargue Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the\nboarded up doors and were in the car speeding toward the highway\nDudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the\nhead for holding them up while he tried to pack his television VCR and\ncomputer in his sports bag\n\nThey drove And they drove Even Aunt Petunia didnt dare ask where they\nwere going Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and\ndrive in the opposite direction for a while Shakeem off shake em\noff he would mutter whenever he did this\n\nThey didnt stop to eat or drink all day By nightfall Dudley was\nhowling Hed never had such a bad day in his life He was hungry hed\nmissed five television programs hed wanted to see and hed never gone\nso long without blowing up an alien on his computer\n\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the\noutskirts of a big city Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds\nand damp musty sheets Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake sitting on\nthe windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and\nwondering\n\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for\nbreakfast the next day They had just finished when the owner of the\nhotel came over to their table\n\nScuse me but is one of you Mr H Potter Only I got about an undred\nof these at the front desk\n\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address\n\nMr H Potter\n\nRoom 17\n\nRailview Hotel\n\nCokeworth\n\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out\nof the way The woman stared\n\nIll take them said Uncle Vernon standing up quickly and following\nher from the dining room\n\nWouldnt it be better just to go home dear Aunt Petunia suggested\ntimidly hours later but Uncle Vernon didnt seem to hear her Exactly\nwhat he was looking for none of them knew He drove them into the\nmiddle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in\nthe car and off they went again The same thing happened in the middle\nof a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of\na multilevel parking garage\n\nDaddys gone mad hasnt he Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that\nafternoon Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside\nthe car and disappeared\n\nIt started to rain Great drops beat on the roof of the car Dud ley\nsniveled\n\nIts Monday he told his mother The Great Humbertos on tonight I\nwant to stay somewhere with a television \n\nMonday This reminded Harry of something If it was Monday    and you\ncould usually count on Dudley to know the days the week because of\ntelevision    then tomorrow Tuesday was Harrys eleventh birthday Of\ncourse his birthdays were never exactly fun    last year the Dursleys\nhad given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernons old socks\nStill you werent eleven every day\n\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling He was also carrying a long\nthin package and didnt answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what hed\nbought\n\nFound the perfect place he said Come on Everyone out\n\nIt was very cold outside the car Uncle Vernon was pointing at what\nlooked like a large rock way out at sea Perched on top of the rock was\nthe most miserable little shack you could imagine One thing was\ncertain there was no television in there\n\nStorm forecast for tonight said Uncle Vernon gleefully clapping his\nhands together And this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his\nboat\n\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather\nwicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below\nthem\n\nIve already got us some rations said Uncle Vernon so all aboard\n\nIt was freezing in the boat Icy sea spray and rain crept down their\nnecks and a chilly wind whipped their faces After what seemed like\nhours they reached the rock where Uncle Vernon slipping and sliding\nled the way to the broken down house\n\nThe inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind\nwhistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was\ndamp and empty There were only two rooms\n\nUncle Vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four\nbananas He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked\nand shriveled up\n\nCould do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfully\n\nHe was in a very good mood Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance\nof reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail Harry privately\nagreed though the thought didnt cheer him up at all\n\nAs night fell the promised storm blew up around them Spray from the\nhigh waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the\nfilthy windows Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second\nroom and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth eaten sofa She and Uncle\nVernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and Harry was left to find\nthe softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest\nmost ragged blanket\n\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on Harry\ncouldnt sleep He shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable\nhis stomach rumbling with hunger Dudleys snores were drowned by the\nlow rolls of thunder that started near midnight The lighted dial of\nDudleys watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat\nwrist told Harry hed be eleven in ten minutes time He lay and\nwatched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the Dursleys would\nremember at all wondering where the letter writer was now\n\nFive minutes to go Harry heard something creak outside He hoped the\nroof wasnt going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did\nFour minutes to go Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of\nletters when they got back that hed be able to steal one somehow\n\nThree minutes to go Was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like\nthat And two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise Was\nthe rock crumbling into the sea\n\nOne minute to go and hed be eleven Thirty seconds twenty  ten\nnine    maybe hed wake Dudley up just to annoy him    three two\none\n\nBOOM\n\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright staring at the\ndoor Someone was outside knocking to come in\n\n\n",
    " FOUR\n\nTHE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\n\nBOOM They knocked again Dudley jerked awake Wheres the cannon he\nsaid stupidly\n\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the\nroom He was holding a rifle in his hands    now they knew what had been\nin the long thin package he had brought with them\n\nWhos there he shouted I warn you    Im armed\n\nThere was a pause Then   \n\nSMASH\n\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and\nwith a deafening crash landed flat on the floor\n\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway His face was almost\ncompletely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled\nbeard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles\nunder all the hair\n\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just\nbrushed the ceiling He bent down picked up the door and fitted it\neasily back into its frame The noise of the storm outside dropped a\nlittle He turned to look at them all\n\nCouldnt make us a cup o tea could yeh Its not been an easy\njourney\n\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear\n\nBudge up yeh great lump said the stranger\n\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who was crouching\nterrified behind Uncle Vernon\n\nAn heres Harry said the giant\n\nHarry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the\nbeetle eyes were crinkled in a smile\n\nLas time I saw you you was only a baby said the giant Yeh look a\nlot like yet dad but yehve got yet moms eyes\n\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise\n\nI demand that you leave at once sit he said You are breaking and\nentering\n\nAh shut up Dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over\nthe back of the sofa jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernons hands bent\nit into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it\ninto a corner of the room\n\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden on\n\nAnyway    Harry said the giant turning his back on the Dursleys a\nvery happy birthday to yeh Got summat fer yeh here    I mighta sat on\nit at some point but itll taste all right\n\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly\nsquashed box Harry opened it with trembling fingers Inside was a\nlarge sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in\ngreen icing\n\nHarry looked up at the giant He meant to say thank you but the words\ngot lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was Who are\nyou\n\nThe giant chuckled\n\nTrue I havent introduced meself Rubeus Hagrid Keeper of Keys and\nGrounds at Hogwarts\n\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harrys whole arm\n\nWhat about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands together\nId not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got it mind\n\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and\nhe snorted He bent down over the fireplace they couldnt see what he\nwas doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire\nthere It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt\nthe warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into a hot bath\n\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and\nbegan taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a\ncopper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several\nchipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from\nbefore starting to make tea Soon the hut was full of the sound and\nsmell of sizzling sausage Nobody said a thing while the giant was\nworking but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt\nsausages from the poker Dudley fidgeted a little Uncle Vernon said\nsharply Dont touch anything he gives you Dudley\n\nThe giant chuckled darkly\n\nYet great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore Dursley don\nworry\n\nHe passed the sausages to Harry who was so hungry he had never tasted\nanything so wonderful but he still couldnt take his eyes off the\ngiant Finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said\nIm sorry but I still dont really know who you are\n\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his\nhand\n\nCall me Hagrid he said everyone does An like I told yeh Im\nKeeper of Keys at Hogwarts    yehll know all about Hogwarts o course\n\nEr    no said Harry\n\nHagrid looked shocked\n\nSorry Harry said quickly\n\nSony barked Hagrid turning to stare at the Dursleys who shrank back\ninto the shadows It s them as should be sorry I knew yeh werent\ngettin yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldnt even know abou\nHogwarts fer cryin out loud Did yeh never wonder where yet parents\nlearned it all\n\nAll what asked Harry\n\nALL WHAT Hagrid thundered Now wait jus one second\n\nHe had leapt to his feet In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut\nThe Dursleys were cowering against the wall\n\nDo you mean ter tell me he growled at the Dursleys that this boy   \nthis boy    knows nothin abou    about ANYTHING\n\nHarry thought this was going a bit far He had been to school after\nall and his marks werent bad\n\nI know some things he said I can you know do math and stuff But\nHagrid simply waved his hand and said About our world I mean Your\nworld My world Yer parents world\n\nWhat world\n\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode\n\nDURSLEY he boomed\n\nUncle Vernon who had gone very pale whispered something that sounded\nlike Mimblewimble Hagrid stared wildly at Harry\n\nBut yeh must know about yet mom and dad he said I mean theyre\nfamous Youre famous\n\nWhat My    my mom and dad werent famous were they\n\nYeh don know yeh don know Hagrid ran his fingers through his\nhair fixing Harry with a bewildered stare\n\nYeh don know what yeh are he said finally\n\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice\n\nStop he commanded Stop right there sit I forbid you to tell the\nboy anything\n\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious\nlook Hagrid now gave him when Hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled\nwith rage\n\nYou never told him Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore\nleft fer him I was there I saw Dumbledore leave it Dursley An\nyouve kept it from him all these years\n\nKept what from me said Harry eagerly\n\nSTOP I FORBID YOU yelled Uncle Vernon in panic\n\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror\n\nAh go boil yet heads both of yeh said Hagrid Harry    yet a\nwizard\n\nThere was silence inside the hut Only the sea and the whistling wind\ncould be heard\n\n   a what gasped Harry\n\nA wizard o course said Hagrid sitting back down on the sofa which\ngroaned and sank even lower an a thumpin goodun Id say once\nyehve been trained up a bit With a mum an dad like yours what else\nwould yeh be An I reckon its abou time yeh read yer letter\n\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope\naddressed in emerald green to Mr H Potter The Floor Hut on the Rock\nThe Sea He pulled out the letter and read\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nHeadmaster ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\nOrder of Merlin First Class Grand Sorc Chf Warlock Supreme\nMugwump International Confed of Wizards\n\nDear Mr Potter\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts\nSchool of Witchcraft and Wizardry Please find enclosed a list of all\nnecessary books and equipment\n\nTerm begins on September 1 We await your owl by no later than July 31\nYours sincerely\n\nMinerva McGonagall\n\nDeputy Headmistress\n\nQuestions exploded inside Harrys head like fireworks and he couldnt\ndecide which to ask first After a few minutes he stammered What does\nit mean they await my owl\n\nGallopin Gorgons that reminds me said Hagrid clapping a hand to\nhis forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet\nanother pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl    a real live\nrather ruffled looking owl    a long quill and a roll of parchment\nWith his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could\nread upside down\n\nDear Professor Dumbledore\n\nGiven Harry his letter\n\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow\n\nWeathers horrible Hope youre Well\n\nHagrid\n\nHagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in its\nbeak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm Then he\ncame back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the\ntelephone\n\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly\n\nWhere was I said Hagrid but at that moment Uncle Vernon still\nashen faced but looking very angry moved into the firelight\n\nHes not going he said\n\nHagrid grunted\n\nId like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him he said\n\nA what said Harry interested\n\nA Muggle said Hagrid its what we call nonmagic folk like thern\nAn its your bad luck you grew up in a family o the biggest Muggles I\never laid eyes on\n\nWe swore when we took him in wed put a stop to that rubbish said\nUncle Vernon swore wed stamp it out of him Wizard indeed\n\nYou knew said Harry You knew Im a    a wizard\n\nKnew shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly Knew Of course we knew How\ncould you not be my dratted sister being what she was Oh she got a\nletter just like that and disappeared off to that that school and came\nhome every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn turning teacups\ninto rats I was the only one who saw her for what she was    a freak\nBut for my mother and father oh no it was Lily this and Lily that\nthey were proud of having a witch in the family\n\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on It seemed\nshe had been wanting to say all this for years\n\nThen she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and\nhad you and of course I knew youd be just the same just as strange\njust as    as    abnormal    and then if you please she went and got\nherself blown up and we got landed with you\n\nHarry had gone very white As soon as he found his voice he said Blown\nup You told me they died in a car crash\n\nCAR CRASH roared Hagrid jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys\nscuttled back to their corner How could a car crash kill Lily an\nJames Potter Its an outrage A scandal Harry Potter not knowin his\nown story when every kid in our world knows his name But why What\nhappened Harry asked urgently\n\nThe anger faded from Hagrids face He looked suddenly anxious\n\nI never expected this he said in a low worried voice I had no\nidea when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin hold of\nyeh how much yeh didnt know Ah Harry I don know if Im the right\nperson ter tell yeh    but someone 3 s gotta    yeh cant go off ter\nHogwarts not knowin\n\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys\n\nWell its best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh    mind I cant\ntell yeh everythin its a great mystry parts of it\n\nHe sat down stared into the fire for a few seconds and then said It\nbegins I suppose with    with a person called    but its incredible\nyeh dont know his name everyone in our world knows   \n\nWho \n\nWell    I don like sayin the name if I can help it No one does\n\nWhy not\n\nGulpin gargoyles Harry people are still scared Blimey this is\ndifficult See there was this wizard who went bad As bad as you\ncould go Worse Worse than worse His name was\n\nHagrid gulped but no words came out\n\nCould you write it down Harry suggested\n\nNah  cant spell it All right    Voldemort  Hagrid shuddered Don\nmake me say it again Anyway this    this wizard about twenty years\nago now started lookin fer followers Got em too    some were\nafraid some just wanted a bit o his power cause he was gettin\nhimself power all right Dark days Harry Didnt know who ter trust\ndidnt dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches terrible\nthings happened He was takin over Course some stood up to him   \nan he killed em Horribly One o the only safe places left was\nHogwarts Reckon Dumbledores the only one You Know Who was afraid of\nDidnt dare try takin the school not jus then anyway\n\nNow yer mum an dad were as good a witch an wizard as I ever knew\nHead boy an girl at Hogwarts in their day Suppose the mystry is why\nYou Know Who never tried to get em on his side before probably knew\nthey were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the\nDark Side\n\nMaybe he thought he could persuade em maybe he just wanted em\noutta the way All anyone knows is he turned up in the village where\nyou was all living on Halloween ten years ago You was just a year old\nHe came ter yer house an    an   \n\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty spotted handkerchief and blew\nhis nose with a sound like a foghorn\n\nSorry he said But its that sad    knew yer mum an dad an nicer\npeople yeh couldnt find    anyway\n\nYou Know Who killed em An then    an this is the real mystry of\nthe thing    he tried to kill you too Wanted ter make a clean job of\nit I suppose or maybe he just liked killin by then But he couldnt\ndo it Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead That was no\nordinary cut Thats what yeh get when a Powerful evil curse touches\nyeh    took care of yer mum an dad an yer house even    but it didnt\nwork on you an thats why yer famous Harry No one ever lived after\nhe decided ter kill em no one except you an hed killed some o the\nbest witches an wizards of the age    the McKinnons the Bones the\nPrewetts    an you was only a baby an you lived\n\nSomething very painful was going on in Harrys mind As Hagrids story\ncame to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more\nclearly than he had ever remembered it before    and he remembered\nsomething else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel\nlaugh\n\nHagrid was watching him sadly\n\nTook yeh from the ruined house myself on Dumbledores orders Brought\nyeh ter this lot\n\nLoad of old tosh said Uncle Vernon Harry jumped he had almost\nforgotten that the Dursleys were there Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to\nhave got back his courage He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were\nclenched\n\nNow you listen here boy he snarled I accept theres something\nstrange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured\n   and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no\ndenying it and the worlds better off without them in my opinion   \nasked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types   \njust what I expected always knew theyd come to a sticky end   \n\nBut at that moment Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink\numbrella from inside his coat Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a\nsword he said Im warning you Dursley  Im warning you    one more\nword \n\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant\nUncle Vernons courage failed again he flattened himself against the\nwall and fell silent\n\nThats better said Hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on\nthe sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor\n\nHarry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of them\n\nBut what happened to Vol   sorry    I mean You Know Who\n\nGood question Harry Disappeared Vanished Same night he tried ter\nkill you Makes yeh even more famous Thats the biggest mystry see\nhe was gettin more an more powerful    whyd he go\n\nSome say he died Codswallop in my opinion Dunno if he had enough\nhuman left in him to die Some say hes still out there bidin his\ntime like but I don believe it People who was on his side came back\nter ours Some of em came outta kinda trances Don reckon they\ncouldve done if he was comin back\n\nMost of us reckon hes still out there somewhere but lost his powers\nToo weak to carry on Cause somethin about you finished him Harry\nThere was somethin goin on that night he hadnt counted on    I dunno\nwhat it was no one does    but somethin about you stumped him all\nright\n\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but\nHarry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had\nbeen a horrible mistake A wizard Him How could he possibly be Hed\nspent his life being clouted by Dudley and bullied by Aunt Petunia and\nUncle Vernon if he was really a wizard why hadnt they been turned\ninto warty toads every time theyd tried to lock him in his cupboard If\nhed once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come Dudley\nhad always been able to kick him around like a football\n\nHagrid he said quietly I think you must have made a mistake I\ndont think I can be a wizard\n\nTo his surprise Hagrid chuckled\n\nNot a wizard eh Never made things happen when you was scared or\nangry\n\nHarry looked into the fire Now he came to think about it every odd\nthing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had\nhappened when he Harry had been upset or angry chased by Dudleys\ngang he had somehow found himself out of their reach dreading going\nto school with that ridiculous haircut hed managed to make it grow\nback and the very last time Dudley had hit him hadnt he got his\nrevenge without even realizing he was doing it Hadnt he set a boa\nconstrictor on him\n\nHarry looked back at Hagrid smiling and saw that Hagrid was positively\nbeaming at him\n\nSee said Hagrid Harry Potter not a wizard    you wait youll be\nright famous at Hogwarts\n\nBut Uncle Vernon wasnt going to give in without a fight\n\nHavent I told you hes not going he hissed Hes going to Stonewall\nHigh and hell be grateful for it Ive read those letters and he needs\nall sorts of rubbish    spell books and wands and   \n\nIf he wants ter go a great Muggle like you wont stop him growled\nHagrid Stop Lily an James Potter s son goin ter Hogwarts Yer mad\nHis names been down ever since he was born Hes off ter the finest\nschool of witchcraft and wizardry in the world Seven years there and he\nwont know himself Hell be with youngsters of his own sort fer a\nchange an hell be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had\nAlbus Dumbled  \n\nI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS\nyelled Uncle Vernon\n\nBut he had finally gone too far Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled\nit over his head NEVER he thundered   INSULT  ALBUS  DUMBLEDORE \nIN  FRONT  OF  ME\n\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley\n   there was a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker a\nsharp squeal and the next second Dudley was dancing on the spot with\nhis hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain When he turned\nhis back on them Harry saw a curly pigs tail poking through a hole in\nhis trousers\n\nUncle Vernon roared Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other\nroom he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door\nbehind them\n\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard\n\nShouldnta lost me temper he said ruefully but it didnt work\nanyway Meant ter turn him into a pig but I suppose he was so much like\na pig anyway there wasnt much left ter do\n\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows\n\nBe grateful if yeh didnt mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts he\nsaid Im    er    not supposed ter do magic strictly speakin I was\nallowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an get yer letters to yeh an stuff\n   one o the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job\n\nWhy arent you supposed to do magic asked Harry\n\nOh well    I was at Hogwarts meself but I    er    got expelled ter\ntell yeh the truth In me third year They snapped me wand in half an\neverything But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper Great man\nDumbledore Why were you expelled\n\nIts gettin late and weve got lots ter do tomorrow said Hagrid\nloudly Gotta get up ter town get all yer books an that\n\nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry\n\nYou can kip under that he said Don mind if it wriggles a bit I\nthink I still got a couple o dormice in one o the pockets\n\n\n",
    " FIVE\n\nDIAGON ALLEY\n\nHarry woke early the next morning Although he could tell it was\ndaylight he kept his eyes shut tight\n\nIt was a dream he told himself firmly I dreamed a giant called\nHagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards When I open\nmy eyes Ill be at home in my cupboard\n\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise\n\nAnd theres Aunt Petunia knocking on the door Harry thought his heart\nsinking But he still didnt open his eyes It had been such a good\ndream\n\nTap Tap Tap\n\nAll right Harry mumbled Im getting up\n\nHe sat up and Hagrids heavy coat fell off him The hut was full of\nsunlight the storm was over Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed\nsofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper\nheld in its beak\n\nHarry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon\nwas swelling inside him He went straight to the window and jerked it\nopen The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid who\ndidnt wake up The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to\nattack Hagrids coat\n\nDont do that\n\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak\nfiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat\n\nHagrid said Harry loudly Theres an owl\n\nPay him Hagrid grunted into the sofa\n\nWhat\n\nHe wants payin fer deliverin the paper Look in the pockets\nHagrids coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets    bunches of\nkeys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabags\nfinally Harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins\n\nGive him five Knuts said Hagrid sleepily\n\nKnuts\n\nThe little bronze ones\n\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg\nso Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it Then\nhe flew off through the open window\n\nHagrid yawned loudly sat up and stretched\n\nBest be Off Harry lots ter do today gotta get up ter London an buy\nall yer stuff fer school\n\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them He had just\nthought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon\ninside him had got a puncture\n\nUm    Hagrid\n\nMm said Hagrid who was pulling on his huge boots\n\nI havent got any money    and you heard Uncle Vernon last night  he\nwont pay for me to go and learn magic\n\nDont worry about that said Hagrid standing up and scratching his\nhead Dyeh think yer parents didnt leave yeh anything\n\nBut if their house was destroyed   \n\nThey didn keep their gold in the house boy Nah first stop fer us is\nGringotts Wizards bank Have a sausage theyre not bad cold    an I\nwouldn say no teh a bit o yer birthday cake neither\n\nWizards have banks\n\nJust the one Gringotts Run by goblins\n\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding\n\nGoblins\n\nYeah    so yehd be mad ter try an rob it Ill tell yeh that Never\nmess with goblins Harry Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer\nanything yeh want ter keep safe    cept maybe Hogwarts As a matter o\nfact I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore Hogwarts\nbusiness Hagrid drew himself up proudly He usually gets me ter do\nimportant stuff fer him Fetchin you gettin things from Gringotts   \nknows he can trust me see\n\nGot everythin Come on then\n\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock The sky was quite clear now and\nthe sea gleamed in the sunlight The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was\nstill there with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm\n\nHow did you get here Harry asked looking around for another boat\nFlew said Hagrid\n\nFlew\n\nYeah    but well go back in this Not spposed ter use magic now Ive\ngot yeh\n\nThey settled down in the boat Harry still staring at Hagrid trying to\nimagine him flying\n\nSeems a shame ter row though said Hagrid giving Harry another of\nhis sideways looks If I was ter    er    speed things up a bit would\nyeh mind not mentionin it at Hogwarts\n\nOf course not said Harry eager to see more magic Hagrid pulled out\nthe pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and\nthey sped off toward land\n\nWhy would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts Harry asked\n\nSpells    enchantments said Hagrid unfolding his newspaper as he\nspoke They say theres dragons guardin the highsecurity vaults And\nthen yeh gotta find yer way    Gringotts is hundreds of miles under\nLondon see Deep under the Underground Yehd die of hunger tryin ter\nget out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat\n\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper the\nDaily Prophet Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to\nbe left alone while they did this but it was very difficult hed never\nhad so many questions in his life\n\nMinistry o Magic messin things up as usual Hagrid muttered turning\nthe page\n\nTheres a Ministry of Magic Harry asked before he could stop\nhimself\n\nCourse said Hagrid They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister 0 \ncourse but hed never leave Hogwarts so old Cornelius Fudge got the\njob Bungler if ever there was one So he pelts Dumbledore with owls\nevery morning askin fer advice\n\nBut what does a Ministry of Magic do\n\nWell their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that theres still\nwitches an wizards up an down the country\n\nWhy\n\nWhy Blimey Harry everyoned be wantin magic solutions to their\nproblems Nah were best left alone\n\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall Hagrid\nfolded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the\nstreet\n\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town\nto the station Harry couldnt blame them Not only was Hagrid twice as\ntall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like\nparking meters and saying loudly See that Harry Things these Muggles\ndream up eh\n\nHagrid said Harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say\nthere are dragons at Gringotts\n\nWell so they say said Hagrid Crikey Id like a dragon\n\nYoud like one\n\nWanted one ever since I was a kid    here we go\n\nThey had reached the station There was a train to London in five\nminutes time Hagrid who didnt understand Muggle money as he\ncalled it gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets\n\nPeople stared more than ever on the train Hagrid took up two seats and\nsat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent\n\nStill got yer letter Harry he asked as he counted stitches Harry\ntook the parchment envelope out of his pocket\n\nGood said Hagrid Theres a list there of everything yeh need\n\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadnt noticed the night\nbefore and read\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and

been to London before Although Hagrid seemed to know\nwhere he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an\nordinary way He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground and\ncomplained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow\n\nI dont know how the Muggles manage without magic he said as they\nclimbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined\nwith shops\n\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all Harry had to do\nwas keep close behind him They passed book shops and music stores\nhamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it\ncould sell you a magic wand This was just an ordinary street full of\nordinary people Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles\nbeneath them Were there really shops that sold spell books and\nbroomsticks Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had\ncooked up If Harry hadnt known that the Dursleys had no sense of\nhumor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything\nHagrid had told him so far was unbelievable Harry couldnt help\ntrusting him\n\nThis is it said Hagrid coming to a halt the Leaky Cauldron Its a\nfamous place\n\nIt was a tiny grubby looking pub If Hagrid hadnt pointed it out\nHarry wouldnt have noticed it was there The people hurrying by didnt\nglance at it Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the\nrecord shop on the other as if they couldnt see the Leaky Cauldron at\nall In fact Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and\nHagrid could see it Before he could mention this Hagrid had steered\nhim inside\n\nFor a famous place it was very dark and shabby A few old women were\nsitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry One of them was\nsmoking a long pipe A little man in a top hat was talking to the old\nbartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut The\nlow buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in Everyone seemed to know\nHagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a\nglass saying The usual Hagrid\n\nCant Tom Im on Hogwarts business said Hagrid clapping his great\nhand on Harrys shoulder and making Harrys knees buckle\n\n\nGood Lord said the bartender peering at Harry is this    can this\nbe   \n\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent\n\nBless my soul whispered the old bartender Harry Potter what an\nhonor\n\nHe hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward Harry and seized his\nhand tears in his eyes\n\nWelcome back Mr Potter welcome back\n\nHarry didnt know what to say Everyone was looking at him The old\nwoman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out\nHagrid was beaming\n\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment Harry\nfound himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron\n\nDoris Crockford Mr Potter cant believe Im meeting you at last\n\nSo proud Mr Potter Im just so proud\n\nAlways wanted to shake your hand    Im all of a flutter\n\nDelighted Mr Potter just cant tell you Diggles the name Dedalus\nDiggle\n\nIve seen you before said Harry as Dedalus Diggles top hat fell off\nin his excitement You bowed to me once in a shop\n\nHe remembers cried Dedalus Diggle looking around at everyone Did\nyou hear that He remembers me Harry shook hands again and again   \nDoris Crockford kept coming back for more\n\nA pale young man made his way forward very nervously One of his eyes\nwas twitching\n\nProfessor Quirrell said Hagrid Harry Professor Quirrell will be\none of your teachers at Hogwarts\n\nP P Potter stammered Professor Quirrell grasping Harrys hand\nc cant t tell you how p  pleased I am to meet you\n\nWhat sort of magic do you teach Professor Quirrell\n\nD Defense Against the D D Dark Arts muttered Professor Quirrell as\nthough hed rather not think about it N not that you n need it eh\nP P Potter He laughed nervously Youll be g getting all your\nequipment I suppose Ive g got to p pick up a new b book on vampires\nm myself He looked terrified at the very thought\n\nBut the others wouldnt let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself It\ntook almost ten minutes to get away from them all At last Hagrid\nmanaged to make himself heard over the babble\n\nMust get on    lots ter buy Come on Harry\n\nDoris Crockford shook Harrys hand one last time and Hagrid led them\nthrough the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was\nnothing but a trash can and a few weeds\n\nHagrid grinned at Harry\n\nTold yeh didnt I Told yeh you was famous Even Professor Quirrell\nwas tremblin ter meet yeh    mind you hes usually tremblin\n\nIs he always that nervous\n\nOh yeah Poor bloke Brilliant mind He was fine while he was\n\nstudyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand\nexperience They say he met vampires in the Black Forest and there\nwas a nasty bit o trouble with a hag    never been the same since\nScared of the students scared of his own subject now wheres me\numbrella\n\nVampires Hags Harrys head was swimming Hagrid meanwhile was\ncounting bricks in the wall above the trash can\n\nThree up two across he muttered Right stand back Harry\n\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella\n\nThe brick he had touched quivered    it wriggled    in the middle a\nsmall hole appeared    it grew wider and wider    a second later they\nwere facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid an archway onto a\ncobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight\n\nWelcome said Hagrid to Diagon Alley\n\nHe grinned at Harrys amazement They stepped through the archway Harry\nlooked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly\nback into solid wall\n\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop\nCauldrons    All Sizes   Copper Brass Pewter Silver    Self Stirring\n   Collapsible said a sign hanging over them\n\nYeah youll be needin one said Hagrid but we gotta get yer money\nfirst\n\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes He turned his head in every\ndirection as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at\nonce the shops the things outside them the people doing their\nshopping A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as\nthey passed saying Dragon liver seventeen Sickles an ounce theyre\nmad\n\nA low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl\nEmporium    Tawny Screech Barn Brown and Snowy Several boys of\nabout Harrys age had their noses pressed against a window with\nbroomsticks in it Look Harry heard one of them say the new Nimbus\nTwo Thousand    fastest ever    There were shops selling robes shops\nselling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen\nbefore windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes\ntottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion\nbottles globes of the moon\n\nGringotts said Hagrid\n\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other\nlittle shops Standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a\nuniform of scarlet and gold was  \n\nYeah thats a goblin said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white\nstone steps toward him The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry\nHe had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and Harry noticed very\nlong fingers and feet He bowed as they walked inside Now they were\nfacing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved\nupon them\n\nEnter stranger but take heed\n\nOf what awaits the sin of greed\n\nFor those who take but do not earn\n\nMust pay most dearly in their turn\n\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\n\nA treasure that was never yours\n\nThief you have been warned beware\n\nOf finding more than treasure there\n\nLike I said Yehd be mad ter try an rob it said Hagrid\n\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a\nvast marble hall About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high\nstools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing\ncoins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses\nThere were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more\ngoblins were showing people in and out of these Hagrid and Harry made\nfor the counter\n\nMorning said Hagrid to a free goblin Weve come ter take some money\noutta Mr Harry Potters safe\n\nYou have his key Sir\n\nGot it here somewhere said Hagrid and he started emptying his\npockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits\nover the goblins book of numbers The goblin wrinkled his nose Harry\nwatched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as\nglowing coals\n\nGot it said Hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key\n\nThe goblin looked at it closely\n\nThat seems to be in order\n\nAn Ive also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore said Hagrid\nimportantly throwing out his chest Its about the YouKnow What in\nvault seven hundred and thirteen\n\nThe goblin read the letter carefully\n\nVery well he said handing it back to Hagrid I will have Someone\ntake you down to both vaults Griphook\n\nGriphook was yet another goblin Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog\nbiscuits back inside his pockets he and Harry followed Griphook toward\none of the doors leading off the hall\n\nWhats the You Know What in vault seven hundred and thirteen Harry\nasked\n\nCant tell yeh that said Hagrid mysteriously Very secret Hogwarts\nbusiness Dumbledores trusted me Moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh\nthat\n\nGriphook held the door open for them Harry who had expected more\nmarble was surprised They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with\nflaming torches It sloped steeply downward and there were little\nrailway tracks on the floor Griphook whistled and a small cart came\nhurtling up the tracks toward them They climbed in    Hagrid with some\ndifficulty    and were off\n\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages Harry\ntried to remember left right right left middle fork right left\nbut it was impossible The rattling cart seemed to know its own way\nbecause Griphook wasnt steering\n\nHarrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them\nwide open Once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a\npassage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late    \nthey plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge\nstalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor\n\nI never know Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart\nwhats the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite\n\nStalagmites got an m in it said Hagrid An don ask me questions\njust now I think Im gonna be sick\n\nHe did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small\ndoor in the passage wall Hagrid got out and had to lean against the\nwall to stop his knees from trembling\n\nGriphook unlocked the door A lot of green smoke came billowing out and\nas it cleared Harry gasped Inside were mounds of gold coins Columns\nof silver Heaps of little bronze Knuts\n\nAll yours smiled Hagrid\n\nAll Harrys    it was incredible The Dursleys couldnt have known about\nthis or theyd have had it from him faster than blinking How often had\nthey complained how much Harry cost them to keep And all the time there\nhad been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under London\n\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag\n\nThe gold ones are Galleons he explained Seventeen silver Sickles to\na Galleon and twenty nine Knuts to a Sickle its easy enough Right\nthat should be enough fer a couple o terms well keep the rest safe\nfor yeh He turned to Griphook Vault seven hundred and thirteen now\nplease and can we go more slowly\n\nOne speed only said Griphook\n\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed The air became\ncolder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners They went\nrattling over an underground ravine and Harry leaned over the side to\ntry to see what was down at the dark bottom but Hagrid groaned and\npulled him back by the scruff of his neck\n\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole\n\nStand back said Griphook importantly He stroked the door gently with\none of his long fingers and it simply melted away\n\nIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that theyd be sucked through\nthe door and trapped in there said Griphook\n\nHow often do you check to see if anyones inside Harry asked\n\nAbout once every ten years said Griphook with a rather nasty grin\n\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault\nHarry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous\njewels at the very least    but at first he thought it was empty Then\nhe noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on\nthe floor Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat Harry\nlonged to know what it was but knew better than to ask\n\nCome on back in this infernal cart and dont talk to me on the way\nback its best if I keep me mouth shut said Hagrid\n\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside\nGringotts Harry didnt know where to run first now that he had a bag\nfull of money He didnt have to know how many Galleons there were to a\npound to know that he was holding more money than hed had in his whole\nlife    more money than even Dudley had ever had\n\nMight as well get yer uniform said Hagrid nodding toward Madam\nMalkins Robes for All Occasions Listen Harry would yeh mind if I\nslipped off fer a pick me up in the Leaky Cauldron I hate them\nGringotts carts He did still look a bit sick so Harry entered Madam\nMalkins shop alone feeling nervous\n\nMadam Malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve\n\nHogwarts clear she said when Harry started to speak Got the lot\nhere    another young man being fitted up just now in fact \n\nIn the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on\na footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes Madam\nMalkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his\nhead and began to pin it to the right length\n\nHello said the boy Hogwarts too\n\nYes said Harry\n\nMy fathers next door buying my books and mothers up the street\nlooking at wands said the boy He had a bored drawling voice Then\nIm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms I dont see why\nfirst years cant have their own I think Ill bully father into getting\nme one and Ill smuggle it in somehow\n\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley\n\nHave you got your own broom the boy went on\n\nNo said Harry\n\nPlay Quidditch at all\n\nNo Harry said again wondering what on earth Quidditch could be\n\nI do    Father says its a crime if Im not picked to play for my\nhouse and I must say I agree Know what house youll be in yet\n\nNo said Harry feeling more stupid by the minute\n\nWell no one really knows until they get there do they but I know\nIll be in Slytherin all our family have been    imagine being in\nHufflepuff I think Id leave wouldnt you Mmm said Harry wishing\nhe could say something a bit more interesting\n\nI say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the\nfront window Hagrid was standing there grinning at Harry and pointing\nat two large ice creams to show he couldnt come in\n\nThats Hagrid said Harry pleased to know something the boy didnt\nHe works at Hogwarts\n\nOh said the boy Ive heard of him Hes a sort of servant isnt\nhe\n\nHes the gamekeeper said Harry He was liking the boy less and less\nevery second\n\nYes exactly I heard hes a sort of savage    lives in a hut on the\nschool grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic\nand ends up setting fire to his bed\n\nI think hes brilliant said Harry coldly\n\nDo you said the boy with a slight sneer Why is he with you Where\nare your parents\n\nTheyre dead said Harry shortly He didnt feel much like going into\nthe matter with this boy\n\nOh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all But they were\nour kind werent they\n\nThey were a witch and wizard if thats what you mean\n\nI really dont think they should let the other sort in do you Theyre\njust not the same theyve never been brought up to know our ways Some\nof them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter\nimagine I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families\nWhats your surname anyway\n\nBut before Harry could answer Madam Malkin said Thats you done my\ndear and Harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy\nhopped down from the footstool\n\nWell Ill see you at Hogwarts I suppose said the drawling boy\n\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him\nchocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts\n\nWhats up said Hagrid\n\nNothing Harry lied They stopped to buy parchment and quills Harry\ncheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you\nwrote When they had left the shop he said Hagrid whats Quidditch\n\nBlimey Harry I keep forgettin how little yeh know    not knowin\nabout Quidditch\n\nDont make me feel worse said Harry He told Hagrid about the pate\nboy in Madam Malkins\n\n  and he said people from Muggle families shouldnt even be allowed\nin\n\nYer not from a Muggle family If hed known who yeh were    hes grown\nup knowin yer name if his parents are wizardin folk You saw what\neveryone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh Anyway what\ndoes he know about it some o the best I ever saw were the only ones\nwith magic in em in a long line 0 Muggles    look at yer mum Look\nwhat she had fer a sister\n\nSo what is Quidditch\n\nIts our sport Wizard sport Its like    like soccer in the Muggle\nworld    everyone follows Quidditch    played up in the air on\nbroomsticks and theres four balls    sorta hard ter explain the rules\nAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff\n\nSchool houses Theres four Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\nduffers but   \n\nI bet Im in Hufflepuff said Harry gloomily\n\nBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin said Hagrid darkly Theres not a\nsingle witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin\nYou Know Who was one\n\nVol  sorry   You Know Who was at Hogwarts\n\nYears an years ago said Hagrid\n\nThey bought Harrys school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts\nwhere the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as\npaving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in\ncovers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with\nnothing in them at all Even Dudley who never read anything would have\nbeen wild to get his hands on some of these Hagrid almost had to drag\nHarry away from Curses and Countercurses Bewitch Your Friends and\nBefuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges Hair Loss Jelly Legs\nTongue  Tying and Much Much More by Professor Vindictus Viridian\n\nI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley\n\nIm not sayin thats not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the\nMuggle world except in very special circumstances said Hagrid An\nanyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yehll need a lot more\nstudy before yeh get ter that level\n\nHagrid wouldnt let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron either It says\npewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing\npotion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope Then they visited\nthe Apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible\nsmell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages Barrels of slimy stuff\nstood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined\nthe walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung\nfrom the ceiling While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a\nsupply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry Harry himself\nexamined silver unicorn horns at twenty one Galleons each and minuscule\nglittery black beetle eyes five Knuts a scoop\n\nOutside the Apothecary Hagrid checked Harrys list again\n\nJust yer wand left   A yeah an I still havent got yeh a birthday\npresent\n\nHarry felt himself go red\n\nYou dont have to   \n\nI know I dont have to Tell yeh what Ill get yer animal Not a toad\ntoads went outta fashion years ago yehd be laughed at   an I don\nlike cats they make me sneeze Ill get yer an owl All the kids want\nowls theyre dead useful carry yer mail an everythin\n\nTwenty minutes later they left Eeylops Owl Emporium which had been\ndark and full of rustling and flickering jewel bright eyes Harry now\ncarried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with\nher head under her wing He couldnt stop stammering his thanks\nsounding just like Professor Quirrell\n\nDon mention it said Hagrid gruffly Don expect youve had a lotta\npresents from them Dursleys Just Ollivanders left now   only place fer\nwands Ollivanders and yeh gotta have the best wand\n\nA magic wand this was what Harry had been really looking forward to\n\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby Peeling gold letters over the door\nread Ollivanders Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC A single wand lay\non a faded purple cushion in the dusty window\n\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped\ninside It was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair\nthat Hagrid sat on to wait Harry felt strangely as though he had\nentered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new questions that\nhad just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow\nboxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling For some reason the back of\nhis neck prickled The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle\nwith some secret magic\n\nGood afternoon said a soft voice Harry jumped Hagrid must have\njumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly\noff the spindly chair\n\nAn old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like\nmoons through the gloom of the shop\n\nHello said Harry awkwardly\n\nAh yes said the man Yes yes I thought Id be seeing you soon\nHarry Potter It wasnt a question You have your mothers eyes It\nseems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand Ten\nand a quarter inches long swishy made of willow Nice wand for charm\nwork\n\nMr Ollivander moved closer to Harry Harry wished he would blink Those\nsilvery eyes were a bit creepy\n\nYour father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand Eleven inches\nPliable A little more power and excellent for transfiguration Well I\nsay your father favored it    its really the wand that chooses the\nwizard of course\n\nMr Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to\nnose Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes\n\nAnd thats where\n\nMr Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harrys forehead with a\nlong white finger\n\nIm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it he said softly\nThirteen and a half inches Yew Powerful wand very powerful and in\nthe wrong hands well if Id known what that wand was going out into\nthe world to do\n\nHe shook his head and then to Harrys relief spotted Hagrid\n\nRubeus Rubeus Hagrid How nice to see you again Oak sixteen\ninches rather bendy wasnt it\n\nIt was sir yes said Hagrid\n\nGood wand that one But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got\nexpelled said Mr Ollivander suddenly stern\n\nEr    yes they did yes said Hagrid shuffling his feet Ive still\ngot the pieces though he added brightly\n\nBut you dont use them said Mr Ollivander sharply\n\nOh no sit said Hagrid quickly Harry noticed he gripped his pink\numbrella very tightly as he spoke\n\nHmmm said Mr Ollivander giving Hagrid a piercing look Well now\n   Mr Potter Let me see He pulled a long tape measure with silver\nmarkings out of his pocket Which is your wand arm\n\nEr    well Im right handed said Harry\n\nHold out your arm Thats it He measured Harry from shoulder to\nfinger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round\nhis head As he measured he said Every Ollivander wand has a core of\na powerful magical substance Mr Potter We use unicorn hairs phoenix\ntail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons No two Ollivander wands\nare the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite\nthe same And of course you will never get such good results with\nanother wizards wand\n\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring\nbetween his nostrils was doing this on its own Mr Ollivander was\nflitting around the shelves taking down boxes\n\nThat will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on\nthe floor Right then Mr Potter Try this one Beechwood and dragon\nheartstring Nine inches Nice and flexible just take it and give it a\nwave\n\nHarry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but Mr\nOllivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once\n\nMaple and phoenix feather Seven inches Quite whippy Try   \n\nHarry tried    but he had hardly raised the wand when it too was\nsnatched back by Mr Ollivander\n\nNo no  here ebony and unicorn hair eight and a half inches springy\nGo on go on try it out\n\nHarry tried And tried He had no idea what Mr Ollivander was waiting\nfor The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the\nspindly chair but the more wands Mr Ollivander pulled from the\nshelves the happier he seemed to become\n\nTricky customer eh Not to worry well find the perfect match here\nsomewhere    I wonder now     yes why not    unusual combination   \nholly and phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple\n\nHarry took the wand He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers He raised\nthe wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air\nand a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework\nthrowing dancing spots of light on to the walls Hagrid whooped and\nclapped and Mr Ollivander cried Oh bravo Yes indeed oh very\ngood Well well well how curious how very curious \n\nHe put Harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper\nstill muttering Curious curious\n\nSorry said Harry but whats curious\n\nMr Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare\n\nI remember every wand Ive ever sold Mr Potter Every single wand It\nso happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave\nanother feather    just one other It is very curious indeed that you\nshould be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave\nyou that scar\n\nHarry swallowed\n\nYes thirteen and a half inches Yew Curious indeed how these things\nhappen The wand chooses the wizard remember I think we must expect\ngreat things from you Mr Potter After all He \nWho Must Not Be Named did great things    terrible yes but great\n\nHarry shivered He wasnt sure he liked Mr Ollivander too much He paid\nseven gold Galleons for his wand and Mr Ollivander bowed them from his\nshop\n\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made\ntheir way back down Diagon Alley back through the wall back through\nthe Leaky Cauldron now empty Harry didnt speak at all as they walked\ndown the road he didnt even notice how much people were gawking at\nthem on the Underground laden as they were with all their funny shaped\npackages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harrys lap Up\nanother escalator out into Paddington station Harry only realized\nwhere they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder\n\nGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he said\n\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat\nthem Harry kept looking around Everything looked so strange somehow\n\nYou all right Harry Yer very quiet said Hagrid\n\nHarry wasnt sure he could explain Hed just had the best birthday of\nhis life    and yet    he chewed his hamburger trying to find the\nwords\n\nEveryone thinks Im special he said at last All those people in the\nLeaky Cauldron Professor Quirrell Mr Ollivander but I dont know\nanything about magic at all How can they expect great things Im\nfamous and I cant even remember what Im famous for I dont know what\nhappened when Vol  sorry    I mean the night my parents died\n\nHagrid leaned across the table Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he\nwore a very kind smile\n\nDon you worry Harry Youll learn fast enough Everyone starts at the\nbeginning at Hogwarts youll be just fine just be yerself I know its\nhard Yehve been singled out an thats always hard But yehll have a\ngreat time at Hogwarts    I did    still do smatter of fact\n\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the\nDursleys then handed him an envelope\n\nYer ticket fer Hogwarts  he said First o September    Kings Cross\n   its all on yer ticket Any problems with the Dursleys send me a\nletter with yer owl shell know where to find me See yeh soon\nHarry\n\nThe train pulled out of the station Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until\nhe was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against\nthe window but he blinked and Hagrid had gone\n\n\n",
    " SIX\n\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS\n\nHarrys last month with the Dursleys wasnt fun True Dudley was now so\nscared of Harry he wouldnt stay in the same room while Aunt Petunia\nand Uncle Vernon didnt shut Harry in his cupboard force him to do\nanything or shout at him    in fact they didnt speak to him at all\nHalf terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with Harry\nin it were empty Although this was an improvement in many ways it did\nbecome a bit depressing after a while\n\nHarry kept to his room with his new owl for company He had decided to\ncall her Hedwig a name he had found in A History of Magic His school\nbooks were very interesting He lay on his bed reading late into the\nnight Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased It\nwas lucky that Aunt Petunia didnt come in to vacuum anymore because\nHedwig kept bringing back dead mice Every night before he went to\nsleep Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned\nto the wall counting down to September the first\n\nOn the last day of August he thought hed better speak to his aunt and\nuncle about getting to Kings Cross station the next day so he went\ndown to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on\ntelevision He cleared his throat to let them know he was there and\nDudley screamed and ran from the room\n\nEr    Uncle Vernon\n\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening\n\nEr    I need to be at Kings Cross tomorrow to    to go to Hogwarts\n\nUncle Vernon grunted again\n\nWould it be all right if you gave me a lift\n\nGrunt Harry supposed that meant yes\n\nThank you\n\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke\n\nFunny way to get to a wizards school the train Magic carpets all got\npunctures have they\n\nHarry didnt say anything\n\nWhere is this school anyway\n\nI dont know said Harry realizing this for the first time He pulled\nthe ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket\n\nI just take the train from platform nine and three quarters at eleven\noclock he read\n\nHis aunt and uncle stared\n\nPlatform what\n\nNine and three quarters\n\nDont talk rubbish said Uncle Vernon There is no platform nine and\nthree quarters\n\nIts on my ticket\n\nBarking said Uncle Vernon howling mad the lot of them Youll see\nYou just wait All right well take you to Kings Cross Were going up\nto London tomorrow anyway or I wouldnt bother\n\nWhy are you going to London Harry asked trying to keep things\nfriendly\n\nTaking Dudley to the hospital growled Uncle Vernon Got to have that\nruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings\n\nHarry woke at five oclock the next morning and was too excited and\nnervous to go back to sleep He got up and pulled on his jeans because\nhe didnt want to walk into the station in his wizards robes    hed\nchange on the train He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure\nhe had everything he needed saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her\ncage and then paced the room waiting for the Dursleys to get up Two\nhours later Harrys huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the\nDursleys car Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to\nHarry and they had set off\n\nThey reached Kings Cross at half past ten Uncle Vernon dumped Harrys\ntrunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him Harry thought\nthis was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead facing the\nplatforms with a nasty grin on his face\n\nWell there you are boy Platform nine    platform ten Your platform\nshould be somewhere in the middle but they dont seem to have built it\nyet do they\n\nHe was quite right of course There was a big plastic number nine over\none platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and\nin the middle nothing at all\n\nHave a good term said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile He\nleft without another word Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away\nAll three of them were laughing Harrys mouth went rather dry What on\nearth was he going to do He was starting to attract a lot of funny\nlooks because of Hedwig Hed have to ask someone\n\nHe stopped a passing guard but didnt dare mention platform nine and\nthree quarters The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry\ncouldnt even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to\nget annoyed as though Harry was being stupid on purpose Getting\ndesperate Harry asked for the train that left at eleven oclock but\nthe guard said there wasnt one In the end the guard strode away\nmuttering about time wasters Harry was now trying hard not to panic\nAccording to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes\nleft to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he\nwas stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly\nlift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl\n\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like\ntapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley He\nwondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket\ninspectors stand between platforms nine and ten\n\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a\nfew words of what they were saying\n\n   packed with Muggles of course   \n\nHarry swung round The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four\nboys all with flaming red hair Each of them was pushing a trunk like\nHarrys in front of him    and they had an owl\n\nHeart hammering Harry pushed his cart after them They stopped and so\ndid he just near enough to hear what they were saying\n\nNow whats the platform number said the boys mother\n\nNine and three quarters piped a small girl also red headed who was\nholding her hand Mom cant I go \n\nYoure not old enough Ginny now be quiet All right Percy you go\nfirst\n\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten\nHarry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it    but just as\nthe boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large\ncrowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last\nbackpack had cleared away the boy had vanished\n\nFred you next the plump woman said\n\nIm not Fred Im George said the boy Honestly woman you call\nyourself our mother CarA you tell Im George\n\nSorry George dear\n\nOnly joking I am Fred said the boy and off he went His twin called\nafter him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later\nhe had gone    but how had he done it\n\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was\nalmost there    and then quite suddenly he wasnt anywhere\n\nThere was nothing else for it\n\nExcuse me Harry said to the plump woman\n\nHello dear she said First time at Hogwarts Rons new too\n\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons He was tall thin and\ngangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long nose\n\nYes said Harry The thing is    the thing is I dont know how to\n  \n\nHow to get onto the platform she said kindly and Harry nodded\n\nNot to worry she said All you have to do is walk straight at the\nbarrier between platforms nine and ten Dont stop and dont be scared\nyoull crash into it thats very important Best do it at a bit of a\nrun if youre nervous Go on go now before Ron\n\nEr    okay said Harry\n\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier It looked very\nsolid\n\nHe started to walk toward it People jostled him on their way to\nplatforms nine and ten Harry walked more quickly He was going to smash\nright into that barrier and then hed be in trouble    leaning forward\non his cart he broke into a heavy run    the barrier was coming nearer\nand nearer    he wouldnt be able to stop    the cart was out of control\n   he was a foot away    he closed his eyes ready for the crash   \n\nIt didnt come he kept on running he opened his eyes A scarlet\nsteam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people A sign\noverhead said Hogwarts Express eleven Oclock Harry looked behind him\nand saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been with the\nwords Platform Nine and Three Quarters on it He had done it\n\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd\nwhile cats of every color wound here and there between their legs Owls\nhooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and\nthe scraping of heavy trunks\n\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging\nout of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats\nHarry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat\nHe passed a round faced boy who was saying Gran Ive lost my toad\nagain\n\nOh Neville he heard the old woman sigh\n\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd\n\nGive us a look Lee go on\n\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him\nshrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg\n\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment\nnear the end of the train He put Hedwig inside first and then started\nto shove and heave his trunk toward the train door He tried to lift it\nup the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it\npainfully on his foot\n\nWant a hand It was one of the red haired twins hed followed through\nthe barrier\n\nYes please Harry panted\n\nOy Fred Cmere and help\n\nWith the twins help Harrys trunk was at last tucked away in a corner\nof the compartment\n\nThanks said Harry pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes\n\nWhats that said one of the twins suddenly pointing at Harrys\nlightning scar\n\nBlimey said the other twin Are you\n\nHe is said the first twin Arent you he added to Harry\n\nWhat said Harry\n\nHarry Potter chorused the twins\n\nOh him said Harry I mean yes I am\n\nThe two boys gawked at him and Harry felt himself turning red Then to\nhis relief a voice came floating in through the trains open door\n\nFred George Are you there\n\nComing Mom\n\nWith a last look at Harry the twins hopped off the train\n\nHarry sat down next to the window where half hidden he could watch the\nred haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying Their\nmother had just taken out her handkerchief\n\nRon youve got something on your nose\n\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way but she grabbed him and\nbegan rubbing the end of his nose\n\nMom    geroff He wriggled free\n\nAaah has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie said one of the\ntwins\n\nShut up said Ron\n\nWheres Percy said their mother\n\nHes coming now\n\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight He had already changed into his\nbillowing black Hogwarts robes and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge\non his chest with the letter P on it\n\nCant stay long Mother he said Im up front the prefects have got\ntwo compartments to themselves   \n\nOh are you a prefect Percy said one of the twins with an air of\ngreat surprise You should have said something we had no idea\n\nHang on I think I remember him saying something about it said the\nother twin Once   \n\nOr twice   \n\nA minute   \n\nAll summer   \n\nOh shut up said Percy the Prefect\n\nHow come Percy gets new robes anyway said one of the twins\n\nBecause hes a prefect said their mother fondly All right dear\nwell have a good term    send me an owl when you get there\n\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left Then she turned to the twins\n\nNow you two    this year you behave yourselves If I get one more owl\ntelling me youve    youve blown up a toilet or   \n\nBlown up a toilet Weve never blown up a toilet\n\nGreat idea though thanks Mom\n\nIts not funny And look after Ron\n\nDont worry ickle Ronniekins is safe with us\n\nShut up said Ron again He was almost as tall as the twins already\nand his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it\n\nHey Mom guess what Guess who we just met on the train\n\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldnt see him looking\n\nYou know that black haired boy who was near us in the station Know who\nhe is\n\nWho\n\nHarry Potter\n\nHarry heard the little girls voice\n\nOh Mom can I go on the train and see him Mom eh please\n\nYouve already seen him Ginny and the poor boy isnt something you\ngoggle at in a zoo Is he really Fred How do you know\n\nAsked him Saw his scar Its really there   like lightning\n\nPoor dear   no wonder he was alone I wondered He was ever so polite\nwhen he asked how to get onto the platform\n\nNever mind that do you think he remembers what You Know Who looks\nlike\n\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern\n\nI forbid you to ask him Fred No dont you dare As though he needs\nreminding of that on his first day at school\n\nAll right keep your hair on\n\nA whistle sounded\n\nHurry up their mother said and the three boys clambered onto the\ntrain They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye and\ntheir younger sister began to cry\n\nDont Ginny well send you loads of owls\n\nWell send you a Hogwarts toilet seat\n\nGeorge\n\nOnly joking Mom\n\nThe train began to move Harry saw the boys mother waving and their\nsister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train\nuntil it gathered too much speed then she fell back and waved\n\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the\ncorner Houses flashed past the window Harry felt a great leap of\nexcitement He didnt know what he was going to but it had to be better\nthan what he was leaving behind\n\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy\ncame in\n\nAnyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite Harry\nEverywhere else is full\n\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down He glanced at Harry and then\nlooked quickly out of the window pretending he hadnt looked Harry saw\nhe still had a black mark on his nose\n\nHey Ron\n\nThe twins were back\n\nListen were going down the middle of the train    Lee Jordans got a\ngiant tarantula down there\n\nRight mumbled Ron\n\nHarry said the other twin did we introduce ourselves Fred and\nGeorge Weasley And this is Ron our brother See you later then\n\nBye said Harry and Ron The twins slid the compartment door shut\nbehind them\n\nAre you really Harry Potter Ron blurted out\n\nHarry nodded\n\nOh  well I thought it might be one of Fred and Georges jokes said\nRon And have you really got    you know\n\nHe pointed at Harrys forehead\n\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar Ron stared\n\nSo thats where You Know Who\n\nYes said Harry but I cant remember it\n\nNothing said Ron eagerly\n\nWell    I remember a lot of green light but nothing else\n\nWow said Ron He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments then as\nthough he had suddenly realized what he was doing he looked quickly out\nof the window again\n\nAre all your family wizards asked Harry who found Ron just as\ninteresting as Ron found him\n\nEr    Yes I think so said Ron I think Moms got a second cousin\nwhos an accountant but we never talk about him\n\nSo you must know loads of magic already\n\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale\nboy in Diagon Alley had talked about\n\nI heard you went to live with Muggles said Ron What are they like\n\nHorrible  well not all of them My aunt and uncle and cousin are\nthough Wish Id had three wizard brothers\n\nFive said Ron For some reason he was looking gloomy Im the sixth\nin our family to go to Hogwarts You could say Ive got a lot to live up\nto Bill and Charlie have already left    Bill was head boy and Charlie\nwas captain of Quidditch Now Percys a prefect Fred and George mess\naround a lot but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks\ntheyre really funny Everyone expects me to do as well as the others\nbut if I do its no big deal because they did it first You never get\nanything new either with five brothers Ive got Bills old robes\nCharlies old wand and Percys old rat\n\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat which was\nasleep\n\nHis names Scabbers and hes useless he hardly ever wakes up Percy\ngot an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldnt aff\n   I mean I got Scabbers instead\n\nRons ears went pink He seemed to think hed said too much because he\nwent back to staring out of the window\n\nHarry didnt think there was anything wrong with not being able to\nafford an owl After all hed never had any money in his life until a\nmonth ago and he told Ron so all about having to wear Dudleys old\nclothes and never getting proper birthday presents This seemed to cheer\nRon up\n\n and until Hagrid told me I didnt know anything about be ing a\nwizard or about my parents or Voldemort\n\nRon gasped\n\nWhat said Harry\n\nYou said You Know Whos name said Ron sounding both shocked and\nimpressed Id have thought you of all people   \n\nIm not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said Harry I\njust never knew you shouldnt See what I mean Ive got loads to\nlearn I bet he added voicing for the first time something that\nhad been worrying him a lot lately I bet Im the worst in the class\n\nYou wont be Theres loads of people who come from Muggle families and\nthey learn quick enough\n\nWhile they had been talking the train had carried them out of London\nNow they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep They were\nquiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick past\n\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the\ncorridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said\nAnything off the cart dears\n\nHarry who hadnt had any breakfast leapt to his feet but Rons ears\nwent pink again and he muttered that hed brought sandwiches Harry went\nout into the corridor\n\nHe had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys and now that he\nhad pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many\nMars Bars as he could carry    but the woman didnt have Mars Bars What\nshe did have were Bettie Botts Every Flavor Beans Droobles Best\nBlowing Gum Chocolate Frogs Pumpkin Pasties Cauldron Cakes Licorice\nWands and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his\nlife Not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid\nthe woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts\n\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped\nit onto an empty seat\n\nHungry are you\n\nStarving said Harry taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty\n\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it There were four\nsandwiches inside He pulled one of them apart and said She always\nforgets I dont like corned beef\n\nSwap you for one of these said Harry holding up a pasty Go on   \n\nYou dont want this its all dry said Ron She hasnt got much\ntime he added quickly you know with five of us\n\nGo on have a pasty said Harry who had never had anything to share\nbefore or indeed anyone to share it with It was a nice feeling\nsitting there with Ron eating their way through all Harrys pasties\ncakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten\n\nWhat are these Harry asked Ron holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs\nTheyre not really frogs are they He was starting to feel that\nnothing would surprise him\n\nNo said Ron But see what the card is Im missing Agrippa\n\nWhat\n\nOh of course you wouldnt know    Chocolate Frogs have cards inside\nthem you know to collect    famous witches and wizards Ive got about\nfive hundred but I havent got Agrippa or Ptolemy\n\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card It showed a\nmans face He wore half  moon glasses had a long crooked nose and\nflowing silver hair beard and mustache Underneath the picture was the\nname Albus Dumbledore\n\nSo this is Dumbledore said Harry\n\nDont tell me youd never heard of Dumbledore said Ron Can I have a\nfrog I might get Agrippa    thanks\n\nHarry turned over his card and read\n\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\n\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times Dumbledore is\nparticularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in\n1945 for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his\nwork on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel Professor Dumbledore\nenjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling\n\nHarry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that\nDumbledores face had disappeared\n\nHes gone\n\nWell you cant expect him to hang around all day said Ron Hell be\nback No Ive got Morgana again and Ive got about six of her do you\nwant it You can start collecting\n\nRons eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be\nunwrapped\n\nHelp yourself said Harry But in you know the Muggle world people\njust stay put in photos\n\nDo they What they dont move at all Ron sounded amazed weird\n\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and\ngave him a small smile Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than\nlooking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards but Harry couldnt keep\nhis eyes off them Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana but\nHengist of Woodcroft Alberic Grunnion Circe Paracelsus and Merlin\nHe finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna who was\nscratching her nose to open a bag of Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans\n\nYou want to be careful with those Ron warned Harry When they say\nevery flavor they mean every flavor    you know you get all the\nordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar  malade but then\nyou can get spinach and liver and tripe George reckons he had a booger \nflavored one once\n\nRon picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a\ncorner\n\nBleaaargh    see Sprouts\n\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans Harry got toast\ncoconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was\neven brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldnt\ntouch which turned out to be pepper\n\nThe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder The neat\nfields had gone Now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green\nhills\n\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced\nboy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in He\nlooked tearful\n\nSorry he said but have you seen a toad at all\n\nWhen they shook their heads he wailed Ive lost him He keeps getting\naway from me\n\nHell turn up said Harry\n\nYes said the boy miserably Well if you see him\n\nHe left\n\nDont know why hes so bothered said Ron If Id brought a toad Id\nlose it as quick as I could Mind you I brought Scabbers so I cant\ntalk\n\nThe rat was still snoozing on Rons lap\n\nHe might have died and you wouldnt know the difference said Ron in\ndisgust I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more\ninteresting but the spell didnt work Ill show you look\n\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking\nwand It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the\nend\n\nUnicorn hairs nearly poking out Anyway\n\nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again\nThe toadless boy was back but this time he had a girl with him She was\nalready wearing her new Hogwarts robes\n\nHas anyone seen a toad Nevilles lost one she said She had a bossy\nsort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth\n\nWeve already told him we havent seen it said Ron but the girl\nwasnt listening she was looking at the wand in his hand\n\nOh are you doing magic Lets see it then\n\nShe sat down Ron looked taken aback\n\nEr    all right\n\nHe cleared his throat\n\nSunshine daisies butter mellow Turn this stupid fat rat yellow\n\nHe waved his wand but nothing happened Scabbers stayed gray and fast\nasleep\n\nAre you sure thats a real spell said the girl Well its not very\ngood is it Ive tried a few simple spells just for practice and its\nall worked for me Nobody in my familys magic at all it was ever such\na surprise when I got my letter but I was ever so pleased of course I\nmean its the very best school of witchcraft there is Ive heard   \nIve learned all our course books by heart of course I just hope it\nwill be enough    Im Hermione Granger by the way who are you\n\nShe said all this very fast\n\nHarry looked at Ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he\nhadnt learned all the course books by heart either\n\nIm Ron Weasley Ron muttered\n\nHarry Potter said Harry\n\nAre you really said Hermione I know all about you of course    I\ngot a few extra books for background reading and youre in Modern\nMagical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great\nWizarding Events of the Twentieth Century\n\nAm I said Harry feeling dazed\n\nGoodness didnt you know Id have found out everything I could if it\nwas me said Hermione Do either of you know what house youll be in\nIve been asking around and I hope Im in Gryffindor it sounds by far\nthe best I hear Dumbledore himself was in it but I suppose Ravenclaw\nwouldnt be too bad Anyway wed better go and look for Nevilles\ntoad You two had better change you know I expect well be there\nsoon\n\nAnd she left taking the toadless boy with her\n\nWhatever house Im in I hope shes not in it said Ron He threw his\nwand back into his trunk Stupid spell    George gave it to me bet he\nknew it was a dud\n\nWhat house are your brothers in asked Harry\n\nGryffindor said Ron Gloom seemed to be settling on him again Mom\nand Dad were in it too I dont know what theyll say if Im not I\ndont suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in\nSlytherin\n\nThats the house Vol  I mean You Know Who was in\n\nYeah said Ron He flopped back into his seat looking depressed\n\nYou know I think the ends of Scabbers whiskers are a bit lighter\nsaid Harry trying to take Rons mind off houses So what do your\noldest brothers do now that theyve left anyway\n\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once hed finished school\n\nCharlies in Romania studying dragons and Bills in Africa doing\nsomething for Gringotts said Ron Did you hear about\n\nGringotts Its been all over the Daily Prophet but I dont suppose you\nget that with the Muggles    someone tried to rob a high security\nvault\n\nHarry stared\n\nReally What happened to them\n\nNothing thats why its such big news They havent been caught My\ndad says it mustve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts\nbut they dont think they took anything thats whats odd Course\neveryone gets scared when something like this happens in case\nYou Know Whos behind it\n\nHarry turned this news over in his mind He was starting to get a\nprickle of fear every time You  Know Who was mentioned He supposed this\nwas all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more\ncomfortable saying Voldemort without worrying\n\nWhats your Quidditch team Ron asked\n\nEr    I dont know any Harry confessed\n\nWhat Ron looked dumbfounded Oh you wait its the best game in the\nworld    And he was off explaining all about the four balls and the\npositions of the seven players describing famous games hed been to\nwith his brothers and the broomstick hed like to get if he had the\nmoney He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game\nwhen the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasnt Neville the\ntoadless boy or Hermione Granger this time\n\nThree boys entered and Harry recognized the middle one at once it was\nthe pale boy from Madam Malkins robe shop He was looking at Harry with\na lot more interest than hed shown back in Diagon Alley\n\nIs it true he said Theyre saying all down the train that Harry\nPotters in this compartment So its you is it\n\nYes said Harry He was looking at the other boys Both of them were\nthickset and looked extremely mean Standing on either side of the pale\nboy they looked like bodyguards\n\nOh this is Crabbe and this is Goyle said the pale boy carelessly\nnoticing where Harry was looking And my names Malfoy Draco Malfoy\n\nRon gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigget Draco\nMalfoy looked at him\n\nThink my names funny do you No need to ask who you are My father\ntold me all the Weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than\nthey can afford\n\nHe turned back to Harry Youll soon find out some wizarding families\nare much better than others Potter You dont want to go making friends\nwith the wrong sort I can help you there\n\nHe held out his hand to shake Harrys but Harry didnt take it\n\nI think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said\ncoolly\n\nDraco Malfoy didnt go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale\ncheeks\n\nId be careful if I were you Potter he said slowly Unless youre a\nbit politer youll go the same way as your parents They didnt know\nwhat was good for them either You hang around with riffraff like the\nWeasleys and that Hagrid and itll rub off on you\n\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up\n\nSay that again Ron said his face as red as his hair\n\nOh youre going to fight us are you Malfoy sneered\n\nUnless you get out now said Harry more bravely than he felt because\nCrabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron\n\nBut we dont feet like leaving do we boys Weve eaten all our food\nand you still seem to have some\n\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron   Ron leapt\nforward but before hed so much as touched Goyle Goyle let out a\nhorrible yell\n\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk\ndeep into Goyles knuckle   Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung\nScabbers round and round howling and when Scabbets finally flew off\nand hit the window all three of them disappeared at once Perhaps they\nthought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps theyd\nheard footsteps because a second later Hermione Granger had come in\n\nWhat has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the\nfloor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail\n\nI think hes been knocked out Ron said to Harry He looked closer at\nScabbers No    I dont believe it    hes gone back to sleep \n\nAnd so he had\n\nYouve met Malfoy before\n\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley\n\nIve heard of his family said Ron darkly They were some of the\nfirst to come back to our side after You Know Who disappeared Said\ntheyd been bewitched My dad doesnt believe it He says Malfoys\nfather didnt need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side He turned to\nHermione Can we help you with something\n\nYoud better hurry up and put your robes on Ive just been up to the\nfront to ask the conductor and he says were nearly there You havent\nbeen fighting have you Youll be in trouble before we even get there\n\nScabbers has been fighting not us said Ron scowling at her Would\nyou mind leaving while we change\n\nAll right    I only came in here because people outside are behaving\nvery childishly racing up and down the corridors said Hermione in a\nsniffy voice And youve got dirt on your nose by the way did you\nknow\n\nRon glared at her as she left Harry peered out of the window It was\ngetting dark He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple\nsky The train did seem to be slowing down\n\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes\nRons were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath\nthem\n\nA voice echoed through the train We will be reaching Hogwarts in five\nminutes time Please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken\nto the school separately\n\nHarrys stomach lurched with nerves and Ron he saw looked pale under\nhis freckles They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and\njoined the crowd thronging the corridor\n\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped People pushed their way\ntoward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform Harry shivered in\nthe cold night air Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the\nstudents and Harry heard a familiar voice Firs years Firs years\nover here All right there Harry\n\nHagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads\n\nCmon follow me    any more firs years Mind yer step now Firs\nyears follow me\n\nSlipping and stumbling they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a\nsteep narrow path It was so dark on either side of them that Harry\nthought there must be thick trees there Nobody spoke much Neville the\nboy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice\n\nYe all get yer firs sight o Hogwarts in a sec Hagrid called over\nhis shoulder jus round this bend here\n\nThere was a loud Oooooh\n\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take\nPerched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in\nthe starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towers\n\nNo moren four to a boat Hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little\nboats sitting in the water by the shore Harry and Ron were followed\ninto their boat by Neville and Hermione Everyone in shouted Hagrid\nwho had a boat to himself Right then    FORWARD\n\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the\nlake which was as smooth as glass Everyone was silent staring up at\nthe great castle overhead It towered over them as they sailed nearer\nand nearer to the cliff on which it stood\n\nHeads down yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they\nall bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain\nof ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face They were carried\nalong a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the\ncastle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they\nclambered out onto rocks and pebbles\n\nOy you there Is this your toad said Hagrid who was checking the\nboats as people climbed out of them\n\nTrevor cried Neville blissfully holding out his hands Then they\nclambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrids lamp coming out at\nlast onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle\n\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge Oak\nfront door\n\nEveryone here You there still got yer toad\n\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle\ndoor\n\n\n",
    " SEVEN\n\nTHE SORTING HAT\n\nThe door swung open at once A tall black haired witch in emerald green\nrobes stood there She had a very stern face and Harrys first thought\nwas that this was not someone to cross\n\nThe firs years Professor McGonagall said Hagrid\n\nThank you Hagrid I will take them from here\n\nShe pulled the door wide The entrance hall was so big you could have\nfit the whole of the Dursleys house in it The stone walls were lit\nwith flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts the ceiling was too\nhigh to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to\nthe upper floors\n\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor Harry\ncould hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right\n the rest of the school must already be here    but Professor McGonagall\nshowed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall They\ncrowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have\ndone peering about nervously\n\nWelcome to Hogwarts said Professor McGonagall The start of term\nbanquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the Great\nHall you will be sorted into your houses The Sorting is a very\nimportant ceremony because while you are here your house will be\nsomething like your family within Hogwarts You will have classes with\nthe rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free\ntime in your house common room\n\nThe four houses are called Gryffindor Hufflepuff Ravenclaw and\nSlytherin Each house has its own noble history and each has produced\noutstanding witches and wizards While you are at Hogwarts your\ntriumphs will earn your house points while any rulebreaking will lose\nhouse points At the end of the year the house with the most points is\nawarded the house cup a great honor I hope each of you will be a\ncredit to whichever house becomes yours\n\nThe Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the\nrest of the school I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as\nyou can while you are waiting\n\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Nevilles cloak which was fastened\nunder his left ear and on Rons smudged nose Harry nervously tried to\nflatten his hair\n\nI shall return when we are ready for you said Professor McGonagall\nPlease wait quietly\n\nShe left the chamber Harry swallowed\n\nHow exactly do they sort us into houses he asked Ron\n\nSome sort of test I think Fred said it hurts a lot but I think he\nwas joking\n\nHarrys heart gave a horrible jolt A test In front of the whole\nschool But he didnt know any magic yet    what on earth would he have\nto do He hadnt expected something like this the moment they arrived\nHe looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified\ntoo No one was talking much except Hermione Granger who was whispering\nvery fast about all the spells shed learned and wondering which one\nshed need Harry tried hard not to listen to her Hed never been more\nnervous never not even when hed had to take a school report home to\nthe Dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig blue He\nkept his eyes fixed on the door Any second now Professor McGonagall\nwould come back and lead him to his doom\n\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air   \nseveral people behind him screamed\n\nWhat the   \n\nHe gasped So did the people around him About twenty ghosts had just\nstreamed through the back wall Pearly white and slightly transparent\nthey glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing\nat the first years They seemed to be arguing What looked like a fat\nlittle monk was saying Forgive and forget I say we ought to give him\na second chance   \n\nMy dear Friar havent we given Peeves all the chances he deserves He\ngives us all a bad name and you know hes not really even a ghost    I\nsay what are you all doing here\n\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years\n\nNobody answered\n\nNew students said the Fat Friar smiling around at them About to be\nSorted I suppose\n\nA few people nodded mutely\n\nHope to see you in Hufflepuff said the Friar My old house you\nknow\n\nMove along now said a sharp voice The Sorting Ceremonys about to\nstart\n\nProfessor McGonagall had returned One by one the ghosts floated away\nthrough the opposite wall\n\nNow form a line Professor McGonagall told the first years and\nfollow me\n\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead Harry got into line\nbehind a boy with sandy hair with Ron behind him and they walked out\nof the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors\ninto the Great Hall\n\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place It was\nlit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair\nover four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting\nThese tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets At the\ntop of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting\nProfessor McGonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a\nhalt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind them\nThe hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the\nflickering candlelight Dotted here and there among the students the\nghosts shone misty silver Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes Harry\nlooked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars He\nheard\n\nHermione whisper Its bewitched to look like the sky outside I read\nabout it in Hogwarts A History\n\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the\nGreat Hall didnt simply open on to the heavens\n\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed\na four legged stool in front of the first years On top of the stool she\nput a pointed wizards hat This hat was patched and frayed and\nextremely dirty Aunt Petunia wouldnt have let it in the house\n\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it Harry thought wildly\nthat seemed the sort of thing    noticing that everyone in the hall was\nnow staring at the hat he stared at it too For a few seconds there\nwas complete silence Then the hat twitched A rip near the brim opened\nwide like a mouth    and the hat began to sing\n\nOh you may not think Im pretty\n\nBut dont judge on what you see\n\nIll eat myself if you can find\n\nA smarter hat than me\n\nYou can keep your bowlers black\n\nYour top hats sleek and tall\n\nFor Im the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\n\nAnd I can cap them all\n\nTheres nothing hidden in your head\n\nThe Sorting Hat cant see\n\nSo try me on and I will tell you\n\nWhere you ought to be\n\nYou might belong in Gryffindor\n\nWhere dwell the brave at heart\n\nTheir daring nerve and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart\n\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff\n\nWhere they are just and loyal\n\nThose patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil\n\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw\n\nif youve a ready mind\n\nWhere those of wit and learning\n\nWill always find their kind\n\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\n\nYoull make your real friends\n\nThose cunning folk use any means\n\nTo achieve their ends\n\nSo put me on Dont be afraid\n\nAnd dont get in a flap\n\nYoure in safe hands though I have none\n\nFor Im a Thinking Cap\n\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song It\nbowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again\n\nSo weve just got to try on the hat Ron whispered to Harry Ill\nkill Fred he was going on about wrestling a troll\n\nHarry smiled weakly Yes trying on the hat was a lot better than\nhaving to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on\nwithout everyone watching The hat seemed to be asking rather alot\nHarry didnt feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment If\nonly the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy\nthat would have been the one for him\n\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of\nparchment\n\nWhen I call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to\nbe sorted she said Abbott Hannah\n\nA pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the\nhat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down A moments pause\n  \n\nHUFFLEPUFF shouted the hat\n\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at\nthe Hufflepuff table Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving\nmerrily at her\n\nBones Susan\n\nHUFFLEPUFF shouted the hat again and Susan scuttled off to sit next\nto Hannah\n\nBoot Terry\n\nRAVENCLAW\n\nThe table second from the left clapped this time several Ravenclaws\nstood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them\n\n Brocklehurst Mandy went to Ravenclaw too but Brown Lavender\nbecame the first new Gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded\nwith cheers Harry could see Rons twin brothers catcalling\n\nBulstrode Millicent then became a Slytherin Perhaps it was Harrys\nimagination after all hed heard about Slytherin but he thought they\nlooked like an unpleasant lot He was starting to feel definitely sick\nnow He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school\nHe had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but\nbecause no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him\n\nFinch Fletchley Justin\n\nHUFFLEPUFF\n\nSometimes Harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at\nothers it took a little while to decide Finnigan Seamus the\nsandy haired boy next to Harry in the line sat on the stool for almost\na whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor\n\nGranger Hermione\n\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head\n\nGRYFFINDOR shouted the hat Ron groaned\n\nA horrible thought struck Harry as horrible thoughts always do when\nyoure very nervous What if he wasnt chosen at all What if he just\nsat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until Professor\nMcGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a\nmistake and hed better get back on the train\n\nWhen Neville Longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called\nhe fell over on his way to the stool The hat took a long time to decide\nwith Neville When it finally shouted GRYFFINDOR Neville ran off\nstill wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it\nto MacDougal Morag\n\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at\nonce the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed SLYTHERIN\n\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle looking pleased with\nhimself\n\nThere werent many people left now Moon Nott Parkinson then a\npair of twin girls Patil and Patil then Perks Sally Anne and\nthen at last    Potter Harry\n\nAs Harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little\nhissing fires all over the hall\n\nPotter did she say\n\nThe Harry Potter\n\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the\nhall full of people craning to get a good look at him Next second he\nwas looking at the black inside of the hat He waited\n\nHmm said a small voice in his ear Difficult Very difficult Plenty\nof courage I see Not a bad mind either Theres talent A my goodness\nyes    and a nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interesting\nSo where shall I put you\n\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought Not Slytherin not\nSlytherin\n\nNot Slytherin eh said the small voice Are you sure You could be\ngreat you know its all here in your head and Slytherin will help you\non the way to greatness no doubt about that    no Well if youre sure\n   better be GRYFFINDOR\n\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall He took off\nthe hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table He was so\nrelieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin he hardly noticed\nthat he was getting the loudest cheer yet Percy the Prefect got up and\nshook his hand vigorously while the Weasley twins yelled We got\nPotter We got Potter Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff\nhed seen earlier The ghost patted his arm giving Harry the sudden\nhorrible feeling hed just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water\n\nHe could see the High Table properly now At the end nearest him sat\nHagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up Harry grinned\nback And there in the center of the High Table in a large gold chair\nsat Albus Dumbledore Harry recognized him at once from the card hed\ngotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train Dumbledores silver hair\nwas the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the\nghosts Harry spotted Professor Quirtell too the nervous young man\nfrom the Leaky Cauldron He was looking very peculiar in a large purple\nturban\n\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted Thomas Dean\na Black boy even taller than Ron joined Harry at the Gryffindor table\nTurpin Lisa became a Ravenclaw and then it was Rons turn He was\npale green by now Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a\nsecond later the hat had shouted GRYFFINDOR\n\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next\nto him\n\nWell done Ron excellent said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry\nas Zabini Blaise was made a Slytherin Professor McGonagall rolled\nup her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away\n\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate He had only just realized how\nhungry he was The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago\n\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet He was beaming at the students\nhis arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to\nsee them all there\n\nWelcome he said Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts Before we begin\nour banquet I would like to say a few words And here they are Nitwit\nBlubber Oddment Tweak\n\nThank you\n\nHe sat back down Everybody clapped and cheered Harry didnt know\nwhether to laugh or not\n\nIs he    a bit mad he asked Percy uncertainly\n\nMad said Percy airily Hes a genius Best wizard in the world But\nhe is a bit mad yes Potatoes Harry\n\nHarrys mouth fell open The dishes in front of him were now piled with\nfood He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table\nroast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon\nand steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries Yorkshire pudding\npeas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint\nhumbugs\n\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry but hed never been\nallowed to eat as much as he liked Dudley had always taken anything\nthat Harry really wanted even if It made him sick Harry piled his\nplate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat\nIt was all delicious\n\nThat does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching Harry\ncut up his steak\n\nCant you   \n\nI havent eaten for nearly four hundred years said the ghost I dont\nneed to of course but one does miss it I dont think Ive in troduced\nmyself Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington at your service Resident ghost\nof Gryffindor Tower\n\nI know who you are said Ron suddenly My brothers told me about you\n   youre Nearly Headless Nick\n\nI would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy    the ghost began\nstiffly but sandy haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted\n\nNearly Headless How can you be nearly headless\n\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasnt\ngoing at all the way he wanted\n\nLike this he said irritably He seized his left ear and pulled His\nwhole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on\na hinge Someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it\nproperly Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces Nearly\nHeadless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said\nSo    new Gryffindors I hope youre going to help us win the house\nchampionship this year Gryffindors have never gone so long without\nwinning Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row The Bloody\nBarons becoming almost unbearable    hes the Slytherin ghost\n\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost\nsitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained\nwith silver blood He was right next to Malfoy who Harry was pleased to\nsee didnt look too pleased with the seating arrangements\n\nHow did he get covered in blood asked Seamus with great interest\n\nIve never asked said Nearly Headless Nick delicately\n\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food\nfaded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before A moment\nlater the desserts appeared Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you\ncould think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam\ndoughnuts trifle strawberries Jell O rice pudding    \n\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their\nfamilies\n\nIm half and half said Seamus Me dads a Muggle Mom didnt tell\nhim she was a witch til after they were married Bit of a nasty shock\nfor him\n\nThe others laughed\n\nWhat about you Neville said Ron\n\nWell my gran brought me up and shes a witch said Neville but the\nfamily thought I was all  Muggle for ages My Great Uncle Algie kept\ntrying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me    he\npushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once I nearly drowned    but\nnothing happened until I was eight Great Uncle Algie came round for\ndinner and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles\nwhen my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let\ngo But I bounced    all the way down the garden and into the road They\nwere all really pleased Gran was crying she was so happy And you\nshould have seen their faces when I got in here    they thought I might\nnot be magic enough to come you see Great Uncle Algie was so pleased\nhe bought me my toad\n\nOn Harrys other side Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about\nlessons I do hope they start right away theres so much to learn Im\nparticularly interested in Transfiguration you know turning something\ninto something else of course its supposed to be very difficult \nYoull be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of\nthing    \n\nHarry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at\n\nthe High Table again Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet\nProfessor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore Professor\nQuirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy\nblack hair a hooked nose and sallow skin\n\nIt happened very suddenly The hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrells\nturban straight into Harrys eyes    and a sharp hot pain shot across\nthe scar on Harrys forehead\n\nOuch Harry clapped a hand to his head\n\nWhat is it asked Percy\n\nN nothing\n\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come Harder to shake off was the\nfeeling Harry had gotten from the teachers look    a feeling that he\ndidnt like Harry at all\n\nWhos that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell he asked Percy\n\nOh you know Quirrell already do you No wonder hes looking so\nnervous thats Professor Snape He teaches Potions but he doesnt want\nto    everyone knows hes after Quirrells job Knows an awful lot about\nthe Dark Arts Snape\n\nHarry watched Snape for a while but Snape didnt look at him again\n\nAt last the desserts too disappeared and Professor Dumbledore got to\nhis feet again The hall fell silent\n\nAhern    just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered I\nhave a few start of term notices to give you\n\nFirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to\nall pupils And a few of our older students would do well to remember\nthat as well\n\nDumbledores twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley\ntwins\n\nI have also been asked by Mr Filch the caretaker to remind you all\nthat no magic should be used between classes in the corridors\n\nQuidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term Anyone\ninterested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch\n\nAnd finally I must tell you that this year the third floor corridor\non the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to\ndie a very painful death\n\nHarry laughed but he was one of the few who did\n\nHes not serious he muttered to Percy\n\nMust be said Percy frowning at Dumbledore Its odd because he\nusually gives us a reason why were not allowed to go somewhere    the\nforests full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that I do think he\nmight have told us prefects at least\n\nAnd now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried\nDumbledore Harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become\nrather fixed\n\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a\nfly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose\nhigh above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into words\n\nEveryone pick their favorite tune said Dumbledore and off we go\nAnd the school bellowed\n\nHogwarts Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts\n\nTeach us something please\n\nWhether we be old and bald\n\nOr young with scabby knees\n\nOur heads could do with filling\n\nWith some interesting stuff\n\nFor now theyre bare and full of air\n\nDead flies and bits of fluff\n\nSo teach us things worth knowing\n\nBring back what weve forgot\n\njust do your best well do the rest\n\nAnd learn until our brains all rot\n\nEverybody finished the song at different times At last only the\nWeasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march\nDumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they\nhad finished he was one of those who clapped loudest\n\nAh music he said wiping his eyes A magic beyond all we do here\nAnd now bedtime Off you trot\n\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds\nout of the Great Hall and up the marble staircase Harrys legs were\nlike lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food He\nwas too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits\nalong the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice\nPercy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging\ntapestries They climbed more staircases yawning and dragging their\nfeet and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when\nthey came to a sudden halt\n\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as\nPercy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him\n\nPeeves Percy whispered to the first years A poltergeist He raised\nhis voice Peeves    show yourself\n\nA loud rude sound like the air being let out of a balloon answered\n\nDo you want me to go to the Bloody Baron\n\nThere was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide\nmouth appeared floating cross  legged in the air clutching the walking\nsticks\n\nOooooooh he said with an evil cackle Ickle Firsties What fun\n\nHe swooped suddenly at them They all ducked\n\nGo away Peeves or the Baronll hear about this I mean it barked\nPercy\n\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on\nNevilles head They heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as\nhe passed\n\nYou want to watch out for Peeves said Percy as they set off again\nThe Bloody Barons the only one who can control him he wont even\nlisten to us prefects Here we are\n\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a\npink silk dress\n\nPassword she said Caput Draconis said Percy and the portrait\nswung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall They all scrambled\nthrough it    Neville needed a leg up    and found themselves in the\nGryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairs\n\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the\nboys through another At the top of a spiral staircase    they were\nobviously in one of the towers    they found their beds at last five\nfour posters hung with deep red velvet curtains Their trunks had\nalready been brought up Too tired to talk much they pulled on their\npajamas and fell into bed\n\n Great food isnt it Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings\nGet off Scabbers Hes chewing my sheets\n\nHarry was going to ask Ron if hed had any of the treacle tart but he\nfell asleep almost at once\n\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange\ndream He was wearing Professor Quirrells turban which kept talking to\nhim telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once because it was\nhis destiny Harry told the turban he didnt want to be in Slytherin it\ngot heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened\npainfully    and there was Malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with\nit  then Malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher Snape whose laugh\nbecame high and cold    there was a burst of green light and Harry woke\nsweating and shaking\n\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he\ndidnt remember the dream at all\n\n\n",
    " EIGHT\n\nTHE POTIONS MASTER\n\nThere look\n\nWhere\n\nNext to the tall kid with the red hair\n\nWearing the glasses\n\nDid you see his face\n\nDid you see his scar\n\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next\nday People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look\nat him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring\nHarry wished they wouldnt because he was trying to concentrate on\nfinding his way to classes\n\nThere were a hundred and forty two staircases at Hogwarts wide\nsweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different\non a Friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to\nremember to jump Then there were doors that wouldnt open unless you\nasked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors\nthat werent really doors at all but solid walls just pretending It\nwas also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed\nto move around a lot The people in the portraits kept going to visit\neach other and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk\n\nThe ghosts didnt help either It was always a nasty shock when one of\nthem glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open Nearly\nHeadless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right\ndirection but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a\ntrick staircase if you met him when you were late for class He would\ndrop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet\npelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab\nyour nose and screech GOT YOUR CONK\n\nEven worse than Peeves if that was possible was the caretaker Argus\nFilch Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their\nvery first morning Filch found them trying to force their way through a\ndoor that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds\ncorridor on the third floor He wouldnt believe they were lost was\nsure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening\nto lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor\nQuirrell who was passing\n\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs Norris a scrawny dust colored creature\nwith bulging lamp like eyes just like Filchs She patrolled the\ncorridors alone Break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of\nline and shed whisk off for Filch whod appear wheezing two seconds\nlater Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than\nanyone except perhaps the Weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly\nas any of the ghosts The students all hated him and it was the dearest\nambition of many to give Mrs Norris a good kick\n\nAnd then once you had managed to find them there were the classes\nthemselves There was a lot more to magic as Harry quickly found out\nthan waving your wand and saying a few funny words\n\nThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every\nWednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the\nmovements of the planets Three times a week they went out to the\ngreenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology with a dumpy little\nwitch called Professor Sprout where they learned how to take care of\nall the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used for\n\nEasily the most boring class was History of Magic which was the only\none taught by a ghost Professor Binns had been very old\n\nindeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got\nup next morning to teach leaving his body behind him Binns droned on\nand on while they scribbled down names and dates and got Emetic the\nEvil and Uric the Oddball mixed up\n\nProfessor Flitwick the Charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had\nto stand on a pile of books to see over his desk At the start of their\nfirst class he took the roll call and when he reached Harrys name he\ngave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight\n\nProfessor McGonagall was again different Harry had been quite right to\nthink she wasnt a teacher to cross Strict and clever she gave them a\ntalking to the moment they sat down in her first class\n\nTransfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you\nwill learn at Hogwarts she said Anyone messing around in my class\nwill leave and not come back You have been warned\n\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again They were all very\nimpressed and couldnt wait to get started but soon realized they\nwerent going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time\nAfter taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match\nand started trying to turn it into a needle By the end of the lesson\nonly Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match Professor\nMcGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and\ngave Hermione a rare smile\n\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense\nAgainst the Dark Arts but Quirrells lessons turned out to be a bit of\na joke His classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said\nwas to ward off a vampire hed met in Romania and was afraid would be\ncoming back to get him one of these days His turban he told them had\nbeen given to him by an African prince as a thank you for getting rid of\na troublesome zombie but they werent sure they believed this story\nFor one thing when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell\nhad fought off the zombie Quirrell went pink and started talking about\nthe weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung\naround the turban and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed\nfull of garlic as well so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went\n\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasnt miles behind everyone\nelse Lots of people had come from Muggle families and like him hadnt\nhad any idea that they were witches and wizards There was so much to\nlearn that even people like Ron didnt have much of a head start\n\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron They finally managed to\nfind their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost\nonce\n\nWhat have we got today Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his\nporridge\n\nDouble Potions with the Slytherins said Ron Snapes Head of\nSlytherin House They say he always favors them    well be able to see\nif its true\n\nWish McGonagall favored us  said Harry Professor McGonagall was head\nof Gryffindor House but it hadnt stopped her from giving them a huge\npile of homework the day before\n\nJust then the mail arrived Harry had gotten used to this by now but\nit had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a\nhundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast\ncircling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters\nand packages onto their laps\n\nHedwig hadnt brought Harry anything so far She sometimes flew in to\nnibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the\nowlery with the other school owls This morning however she fluttered\ndown between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto\nHarrys plate Harry tore it open at once It said in a very untidy\nscrawl\n\n\nDear Harry\n\nI know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have\na cup of tea with me around three\n\nI want to hear all about your first week Send us an answer back with\nHedwig\n\nHagrid\n\n\nHarry borrowed Rons quill scribbled Yes please see you later on the\nback of the note and sent Hedwig off again\n\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to because\nthe Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to\nhim so far\n\nAt the start of term banquet Harry had gotten the idea that Professor\nSnape disliked him By the end of the first Potions lesson he knew hed\nbeen wrong Snape didnt dislike Harry    he hated him\n\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons It was colder\nhere than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough\nwithout the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls\n\nSnape like Flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and\nlike Flitwick he paused at Harrys name\n\nAh Yes he said softly Harry Potter Our new    celebrity\n\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their\nhands Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class His\neyes were black like Hagrids but they had none of Hagrids warmth\nThey were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels\n\nYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of\npotionmaking he began He spoke in barely more than a whisper but\nthey caught every word    like Professor McGonagall Snape had y caught\nevery word    like Professor McGonagall Snape had the gift of keeping a\nclass silent without effort As there is little foolish wand waving\nhere many of you will hardly believe this is magic I dont expect you\nwill really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with\nits shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that creep through\nhuman veins bewitching the mind ensnaring the senses I can teach\nyou how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death    if you arent\nas big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach\n\nMore silence followed this little speech Harry and Ron exchanged looks\nwith raised eyebrows Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and\nlooked desperate to start proving that she wasnt a dunderhead\n\nPotter said Snape suddenly What would I get if I added powdered\nroot of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood\n\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what Harry glanced at Ron who\nlooked as stumped as he was Hermiones hand had shot into the air\n\nI dont know sit said Harry\n\nSnapes lips curled into a sneer\n\nTut tut    fame clearly isnt everything\n\nHe ignored Hermiones hand\n\nLets try again Potter where would you look if I told you to find me\na bezoar\n\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without\nher leaving her seat but Harry didnt have the faintest idea what a\nbezoar was He tried not to look at Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle who were\nshaking with laughter\n\nI dont know sit Thought you wouldnt open a book before coming\neh Potter Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those\ncold eyes He had looked through his books at the Dursleys but did\nSnape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs\nand Fungi\n\nSnape was still ignoring Hermiones quivering hand\n\nWhat is the difference Potter between monkshood and wolfsbane\n\nAt this Hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon\nceiling\n\nI dont know said Harry quietly I think Hermione does though why\ndont you try her\n\nA few people laughed Harry caught Seamuss eye and Seamus winked\nSnape however was not pleased\n\nSit down he snapped at Hermione For your information Potter\nasphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as\nthe Draught of Living Death A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach\nof a goat and it will save you from most poisons As for monkshood and\nwolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of\naconite Well Why arent you all copying that down\n\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment Over the noise\nSnape said And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your\ncheek Potter\n\nThings didnt improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson\ncontinued Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a\nsimple potion to cure boils He swept around in his long black cloak\nwatching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing\nalmost everyone except Malfoy whom he seemed to like He was just\ntelling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned\nslugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the\ndungeon Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamuss cauldron into a\ntwisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor\nburning holes in peoples shoes Within seconds the whole class was\nstanding on their stools while Neville who had been drenched in the\npotion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils\nsprang up all over his arms and legs\n\nIdiot boy snarled Snape clearing the spilled potion away with one\nwave of his wand I suppose you added the porcupine quills before\ntaking the cauldron off the fire\n\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose\n\nTake him up to the hospital wing Snape spat at Seamus Then he\nrounded on Harry and Ron who had been working next to Neville\n\nYou    Potter    why didnt you tell him not to add the quills Thought\nhed make you look good if he got it wrong did you Thats another\npoint youve lost for Gryffindor\n\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue but Ron kicked\nhim behind their cauldron\n\nDoi push it he muttered Ive heard Snape can turn very nasty\n\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later Harrys mind\nwas racing and his spirits were low Hed lost two points for Gryffindor\nin his very first week    why did Snape hate him so much Cheer up\nsaid Ron Snapes always taking points off Fred and George Can I come\nand meet Hagrid with you\n\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the\ngrounds Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the\nforbidden forest A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the\nfront door\n\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and\nseveral booming barks Then Hagrids voice rang out saying Back Fang\n   back\n\nHagrids big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door\nopen\n\nHang on he said Back Fang\n\nHe let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous\nblack boarhound\n\nThere was only one room inside Hams and pheasants were hanging from the\nceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner\nstood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it\n\nMake yerselves at home said Hagrid letting go of Fang who bounded\nstraight at Ron and started licking his ears Like Hagrid Fang was\nclearly not as fierce as he looked\n\nThis is Ron Harry told Hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a\nlarge teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate\n\nAnother Weasley eh said Hagrid glancing at Rons freckles I spent\nhalf me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forest\n\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their\nteeth but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told\nHagrid all about their first  lessons Fang rested his head on Harrys\nknee and drooled all over his robes\n\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch that old git\n\nAn as fer that cat Mrs Norris Id like ter introduce her to Fang\nsometime Dyeh know every time I go up ter the school she follows me\neverywhere Cant get rid of her    Fitch puts her up to it\n\nHarry told Hagrid about Snapes lesson Hagrid like Ron told Harry not\nto worry about it that Snape liked hardly any of the students\n\nBut he seemed to really hate me\n\nRubbish said Hagrid Why should he\n\nYet Harry couldnt help thinking that Hagrid didnt quite meet his eyes\nwhen he said that\n\nHows yer brother Charlie Hagrid asked Ron I liked him a lot   \ngreat with animals\n\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose While Ron\ntold Hagrid all about Charlies work with dragons Harry picked up a\npiece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy It was a\ncutting from the Daily Prophet\n\nGRINGOTTS BREAK IN LATEST\n\nInvestigations continue into the break in at Gringotts on 31 July\nwidely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown\n\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken The vault\nthat was searched had in fact been emptied the same day\n\nBut were not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if\nyou know whats good for you said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this\nafternoon\n\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to\nrob Gringotts but Ron hadnt mentioned the date\n\nHagrid said Harry that Gringotts break in happened on my birthday\nIt mightve been happening while we were there\n\nThere was no doubt about it Hagrid definitely didnt meet Harrys eyes\nthis time He grunted and offered him another rock cake Harry read the\nstory again The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied\nearlier that same day Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and\nthirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little\npackage Had that been what the thieves were looking for\n\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets\nweighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite to refuse Harry\nthought that none of the lessons hed had so far had given him as much\nto think about as tea with Hagrid Had Hagrid collected that package\njust in time Where was it now And did Hagrid know something about\nSnape that he didnt want to tell Harry\n\n\n",
    " NINE\n\nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL\n\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley\nbut that was before he met Draco Malfoy\tStill first year\nGryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins so they didnt have to\nput up with Malfoy much Or at least they didnt until they spotted a\nnotice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan\nFlying lessons would be starting on Thursday    and Gryffindor and\nSlytherin\twould be learning together\n\nTypical said Harry darkly Just what I always wanted To make a fool\nof myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy\n\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else\n\nYou dont know that youll make a fool of yourself said Ron\nreasonably Anyway I know Malfoys always going on about how good he\nis at Quidditch but I bet thats all talk\n\nMalfay certainly did talk about flying a lot He complained loudly about\nfirst years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long\nboastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping\nMuggles in helicopters He wasnt the only one though the way Seamus\nFinnigan told it hed spent most of his childhood zooming around the\ncountryside on his broomstick Even Ron would tell anyone whod listen\nabout the time hed almost hit a hang glider on Charlies old broom\nEveryone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly Ron\nhad already had a big argument with Dean Thomas who shared their\ndormitory about soccer Ron couldnt see what was exciting about a game\nwith only one ball where no one was allowed to fly Harry had caught Ron\nprodding Deans poster of West Ham soccer team trying to make the\nplayers move\n\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his\ngrandmother had never let him near one Privately Harry felt shed had\ngood reason because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of\naccidents even with both feet on the ground\n\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was This\nwas something you couldnt learn by heart out of a book    not that she\nhadnt tried At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with\nflying tips shed gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through\nthe Ages Neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for\nanything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but\neverybody else was very pleased when Hermiones lecture was interrupted\nby the arrival of the mail\n\nHarry hadnt had a single letter since Hagrids note something that\nMalfoy had been quick to notice of course Malfoys eagle owl was\nalways bringing him packages of sweets from home which he opened\ngloatingly at the Slytherin table\n\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother He\nopened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large\nmarble which seemed to be full of white smoke\n\nIts a Remembrall he explained Gran knows I forget things    this\ntells you if theres something youve forgotten to do Look you hold it\ntight like this and if it turns red    oh His face fell because the\nRemembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet\n\nYouve forgotten something\n\nNeville was trying to remember what hed forgotten when Draco Malfoy\nwho was passing the Gryffindor table snatched the Remembrall out of his\nhand\n\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet They were half hoping for a reason\nto fight Malfay but Professor McGonagall who could spot trouble\nquicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flash\n\nWhats going on\n\nMalfoys got my Remembrall Professor\n\nScowling Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table\n\nJust looking he said and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind\nhim\n\nAt three thirty that afternoon Harry Ron and the other Gryffindors\nhurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying\nlesson It was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their\nfeet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn\non the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees\nwere swaying darkly in the distance\n\nThe Slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying\nin neat lines on the ground Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley\ncomplain about the school brooms saying that some of them started to\nvibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly to the left\n\nTheir teacher Madam Hooch arrived She had short gray hair and\nyellow eyes like a hawk\n\nWell what are you all waiting for she barked Everyone stand by a\nbroomstick Come on hurry up\n\nHarry glanced down at his broom It was old and some of the twigs stuck\nout at odd angles\n\nStick out your right hand over your broom called Madam Hooch at the\nfront and say Up\n\nUPF everyone shouted\n\nHarrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few\nthat did Hermione Grangers had simply rolled over on the ground and\nNevilles hadnt moved at all Perhaps brooms like horses could tell\nwhen you were afraid thought Harry there was a quaver in Nevilles\nvoice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the\nground\n\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding\noff the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips\nHarry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy hed been doing it\nwrong for years\n\nNow when I blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said\nMadam Hooch Keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come\nstraight back down by leaning forward slightly On my whistle    three\n   two   \n\nBut Neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the\nground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hoochs\nlips\n\nCome back boy she shouted but Neville was rising straight up like a\ncork shot out of a bottle    twelve feet    twenty feet Harry saw his\nscared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp\nslip sideways off the broom and   \n\nWHAM    a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass\nin a heap His broomstick was still rising higher and higher and\nstarted to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight\n\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville her face as white as his\n\nBroken wrist Harry heard her mutter Come on boy    its all right\nup you get\n\nShe turned to the rest of the class\n\nNone of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing You\nleave those brooms where they are or youll be out of Hogwarts before\nyou can say Quidditch Come on dear\n\nNeville his face tear streaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with\nMadam Hooch who had her arm around him\n\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter\n\nDid you see his face the great lump\n\nThe other Slytherins joined in\n\nShut up Malfoy snapped Parvati Patil\n\nOoh sticking up for Longbottom said Pansy Parkinson a hard faced\nSlytherin girl Never thought youd like fat little crybabies\nParvati\n\nLook said Malfoy darting forward and snatching something out of the\ngrass Its that stupid thing Longbottoms gran sent him\n\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up\n\nGive that here Malfoy said Harry quietly Everyone stopped talking\nto watch\n\nMalfoy smiled nastily\n\nI think Ill leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find    how about   \nup a tree\n\nGive it here Harry yelled but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick\nand taken off He hadnt been lying he could fly well Hovering level\nwith the topmost branches of an oak he called Come and get it\nPotter\n\nHarry grabbed his broom\n\nNo shouted Hermione Granger Madam Hooch told us not to move   \nyoull get us all into trouble\n\nHarry ignored her Blood was pounding in his ears He mounted the broom\nand kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed\nthrough his hair and his robes whipped out behind him  and in a rush of\nfierce joy he realized hed found something he could do without being\ntaught    this was easy this was wonderful He pulled his broomstick up\na little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls\nback on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron\n\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair Malfoy looked\nstunned\n\nGive it here Harry called or Ill knock you off that broom Oh\nyeah said Malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried\n\nHarry knew somehow what to do He leaned forward and grasped the broom\ntightly in both hands and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin Malfoy\nonly just got out of the way in time Harry made a sharp about face and\nheld the broom steady A few people below were clapping\n\nNo Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck Malfoy Harry called\n\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy\n\nCatch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball\nhigh into the air and streaked back toward the ground\n\nHarry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and\nthen start to fall He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down\n   next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball\n   wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people\nwatching    he stretched out his hand    a foot from the ground he\ncaught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled\ngently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist\n\nHARRY POTTER\n\nHis heart sank faster than hed just dived Professor McGonagall was\nrunning toward them He got to his feet trembling\n\nNever    in all my time at Hogwarts   \n\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses\nflashed furiously    how dare you    might have broken your neck   \n\nIt wasnt his fault Professor   \n\nBe quiet Miss Patil\n\nBut Malfoy   \n\nThats enough Mr Weasley Potter follow me now\n\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy Crabbe and Goyles triumphant faces as he\nleft walking numbly in Professor McGonagalls wake as she strode toward\nthe castle He was going to be expelled he just knew it He wanted to\nsay something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong\nwith his voice Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even\nlooking at him he had to jog to keep up Now hed done it He hadnt\neven lasted two weeks Hed be packing his bags in ten minutes What\nwould the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep\n\nUp the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still Professor\nMcGonagall didnt say a word to him She wrenched open doors and marched\nalong corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her Maybe she was\ntaking him to Dumbledore He thought of Hagrid expelled but allowed to\nstay on as gamekeeper Perhaps he could be Hagrids assistant His\nstomach twisted as he imagined it watching Ron and the others becoming\nwizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrids bag\n\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom She opened the door\nand poked her head inside\n\nExcuse me Professor Flitwick could I borrow Wood for a moment\n\nWood thought Harry bewildered was Wood a cane she was going to use on\nhim\n\nBut Wood turned out to be a person a burly fifth year boy who came out\nof Flitwicles class looking confused\n\nFollow me you two said Professor McGonagall and they marched on up\nthe corridor Wood looking curiously at Harry\n\nIn here\n\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except\nfor Peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard\n\nOut Peeves she barked Peeves threw the chalk into a bin which\nclanged loudly and he swooped out cursing Professor McGonagall slammed\nthe door behind him and turned to face the two boys\n\nPotter this is Oliver Wood Wood    Ive found you a Seeker\n\nWoods expression changed from puzzlement to delight\n\nAre you serious Professor\n\nAbsolutely said Professor McGonagall crisply The boys a natural\nIve never seen anything like it Was that your first time on a\nbroomstick Potter\n\nHarry nodded silently He didnt have a clue what was going on but he\ndidnt seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming\nback to his legs\n\nHe caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive Professor\nMcGonagall told Wood Didnt even scratch himself Charlie Weasley\ncouldnt have done it\n\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once\n\nEver seen a game of Quidditch Potter he asked excitedly\n\nWoods captain of the Gryffindor team Professor McGonagall explained\n\nHes just the build for a Seeker too said Wood now walking around\nHarry and staring at him Light    speedy    well have to get him a\ndecent broom Professor    a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven\nId say\n\nI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we cant bend the\nfirst year rule Heaven knows we need a better team than last year\nFlattened in that last match by Slytherin I couldnt look Severus Snape\nin the face for weeks\n\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry\n\nI want to hear youre training hard Potter or I may change my mind\nabout punishing you\n\nThen she suddenly smiled\n\nYour father would have been proud she said He was an excellent\nQuidditch player himself\n\nYoure joking\n\nIt was dinnertime Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened\nwhen hed left the grounds with Professor McGonagall Ron had a piece of\nsteak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but hed forgotten all about\nit\n\nSeeker he said But first years never    you must be the youngest\nhouse player in about a century said Harry shoveling pie into his\nmouth He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the\nafternoon Wood told me\n\nRon was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at Harry\n\nI start training next week said Harry Only dont tell anyone Wood\nwants to keep it a secret\n\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall spotted Harry and\nhurried over\n\nWell done said George in a low voice Wood told us Were on the\nteam too    Beaters\n\nI tell you were going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year\nsaid Fred We havent won since Charlie left but this years team is\ngoing to be brilliant You must be good Harry Wood was almost skipping\nwhen he told us\n\nAnyway weve got to go Lee Jordan reckons hes found a new secret\npassageway out of the school\n\nBet its that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found\nin our first week See you\n\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome\nturned up Malfoy flanked by Crabbe and Goyle\n\nHaving a last meal Potter When are you getting the train back to the\nMuggles\n\nYoure a lot braver now that youre back on the ground and youve got\nyour little friends with you said Harry coolly There was of course\nnothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle but as the High Table was\nfull of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their\nknuckles and scowl\n\nId take you on anytime on my own said Malfoy Tonight if you want\nWizards duel Wands only    no contact Whats the matter Never heard\nof a wizards duel before I suppose\n\nOf course he has said Ron wheeling around Im his second whos\nyours\n\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle sizing them up\n\nCrabbe he said Midnight all right Well meet you in the trophy\nroom thats always unlocked\n\nWhen Malfoy had gone Ron and Harry looked at each other What is a\nwizards duel said Harry And what do you mean youre my second\n\nWell a seconds there to take over if you die said Ron casually\ngetting started at last on his cold pie Catching the look on Harrys\nface he added quickly But people only die in proper duels you know\nwith real wizards The most you and Malfoyll be able to do is send\nsparks at each other Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real\ndamage I bet he expected you to refuse anyway\n\nAnd what if I wave my wand and nothing happens\n\nThrow it away and punch him on the nose Ron suggested Excuse me\n\nThey both looked up It was Hermione Granger\n\nCant a person eat in peace in this place said Ron\n\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry\n\nI couldnt help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying   \n\nBet you could Ron muttered\n\n  and you mustnt go wandering around the school at night think of the\npoints youll lose Gryffindor if youre caught and youre bound to be\nIts really very selfish of you\n\nAnd its really none of your business said Harry\n\nGood bye said Ron\n\nAll the same it wasnt what youd call the perfect end to the day\nHarry thought as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus\nfalling asleep Neville wasnt back from the hospital wing Ron had\nspent all evening giving him advice such as If he tries to curse you\nyoud better dodge it because I cant remember how to block them\nThere was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or\nMrs Norris and Harry felt he was pushing his luck breaking another\nschool rule today On the other hand Malfoys sneering face kept looming\nup out of the darkness   this was his big chance to beat Malfoy\nface to face He couldnt miss it\n\nHalf past eleven Ron muttered at last wed better go\n\nThey pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across\nthe tower room down the spiral staircase and into the Gryffindor\ncommon room A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning\nall the armchairs into hunched black shadows They had almost reached\nthe portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them I\ncant believe youre going to do this Harry\n\nA lamp flickered on It was Hermione Granger wearing a pink bathrobe\nand a frown\n\nYou said Ron furiously Go back to bed\n\nI almost told your brother Hermione snapped Percy    hes a\nprefect hed put a stop to this\n\nHarry couldnt believe anyone could be so interfering\n\nCome on he said to Ron He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady\nand climbed through the hole\n\nHermione wasnt going to give up that easily She followed Ron through\nthe portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose\n\nDont you care about Gryffindor do you only care about yourselves I\ndont want Slytherin to win the house cup and youll lose all the\npoints I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching\nSpells\n\nGo away All right but I warned you you just remember what I said\nwhen youre on the train home tomorrow youre so   \n\nBut what they were they didnt find out Hermione had turned to the\nportrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an\nempty painting The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione\nwas locked out of Gryffindor tower\n\nNow what am I going to do she asked shrilly\n\nThats your problem said Ron Weve got to go we 3 re going to be\nlate\n\nThey hadnt even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up\nwith them\n\nIm coming with you she said\n\nYou are not\n\nDyou think Im going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me\nIf he finds all three of us Ill tell him the truth that I was trying\nto stop you and you can back me up\n\nYouve got some nerve    said Ron loudly\n\nShut up both of you said Harry sharply I heard something\n\nIt was a sort of snuffling\n\nMrs Norris breathed Ron squinting through the dark\n\nIt wasnt Mrs Norris It was Neville He was curled up on the floor\nfast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer\n\nThank goodness you found me Ive been out here for hours I couldnt\nremember the new password to get in to bed\n\nKeep your voice down Neville The passwords Pig snout but it wont\nhelp you now the Fat Ladys gone off somewhere\n\nHows your arm said Harry\n\nFine said Neville showing them Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a\nminute\n\nGood   well look Neville weve got to be somewhere well see you\nlater   \n\nDont leave me said Neville scrambling to his feet I dont want to\nstay here alone the Bloody Barons been past twice already\n\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and\nNeville\n\nIf either of you get us caught Ill never rest until Ive learned that\nCurse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about and used it on you\n\nHermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the\nCurse of the Bogies but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned\nthem all forward\n\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the\nhigh windows At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs\nNorris but they were lucky They sped up a staircase to the third floor\nand tiptoed toward the trophy room\n\nMalfoy and Crabbe werent there yet The crystal trophy cases glimmered\nwhere the moonlight caught them Cups shields plates and statues\nwinked silver and gold in the darkness They edged along the walls\nkeeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room Harry took\nout his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once The minutes\ncrept by\n\nHes late maybe hes chickened out Ron whispered\n\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump Harry had only just raised\nhis wand when they heard someone speak  and it wasnt Malfoy\n\nSniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner\n\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs Norris Horror struck Harry waved madly\nat the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried\nsilently toward the door away from Filchs voice Nevilles robes had\nbarely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy\nroom\n\nTheyre in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding\n\nThis way Harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to\ncreep down a long gallery full of suits of armor They could hear Filch\ngetting nearer Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke\ninto a run  he tripped grabbed Ron around the waist and the pair of\nthem toppled right into a suit of armor\n\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle\n\nRUN Harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not\nlooking back to see whether Filch was following    they swung around the\ndoorpost and galloped down one corridor then another Harry in the lead\nwithout any idea where they were or where they were going    they ripped\nthrough a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled\nalong it and came out near their Charms classroom which they knew was\nmiles from the trophy room\n\nI think weve lost him Harry panted leaning against the cold wall\nand wiping his forehead Neville was bent double wheezing and\nspluttering\n\nI    told  you Hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest\nI    told    you\n\nWeve got to get back to Gryffindor tower said Ron quickly as\npossible\n\nMalfoy tricked you Hermione said to Harry You realize that dont\nyou He was never going to meet you    Filch knew someone was going to\nbe in the trophy room Malfoy must have tipped him off\n\nHarry thought she was probably right but he wasnt going to tell her\nthat\n\nLets go\n\nIt wasnt going to be that simple They hadnt gone more than a dozen\npaces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a\nclassroom in front of them\n\nIt was Peeves He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight\n\nShut up Peeves    please    youll get us thrown out\n\nPeeves cackled\n\nWandering around at midnight Ickle Firsties Tut tut tut Naughty\nnaughty youll get caughty\n\nNot if you dont give us away Peeves please\n\nShould tell Filch I should said Peeves in a saintly voice but his\neyes glittered wickedly Its for your own good you know\n\nGet out of the way snapped Ron taking a swipe at Peeves this was a\nbig mistake\n\nSTUDENTS OUT OF BED Peeves bellowed STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE\nCHARMS CORRIDOR\n\nDucking under Peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the\ncorridor where they slammed into a door    and it was locked\n\nThis is it Ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door Were\ndone for This is the end They could hear footsteps Filch running as\nfast as he could toward Peevess shouts\n\nOh move over Hermione snarled She grabbed Harrys wand tapped the\nlock and whispered Alohomora\n\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open    they piled through it shut\nit quickly and pressed their ears against it listening\n\nWhich way did they go Peeves Filch was saying Quick tell me\n\nSay please\n\nDont mess with me Peeves now where did they go\n\nShant say nothing if you dont say please said Peeves in his\nannoying singsong voice\n\nAll right  please\n\nNOTHING Ha haaa Told you I wouldnt say nothing if you didnt say\nplease Ha ha Haaaaaa And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing\naway and Filch cursing in rage\n\nHe thinks this door is locked Harry whispered I think well be okay\n   get off Neville For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of\nHarrys bathrobe for the last minute What\n\nHarry turned around    and saw quite clearly what For a moment he\nwas sure hed walked into a nightmare    this was too much on top of\neverything that had happened so far\n\nThey werent in a room as he had supposed They were in a corridor The\nforbidden corridor on the third floor And now they knew why it was\nforbidden\n\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog a dog that\nfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor It had three heads\nThree pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching\n\nand quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging\nin slippery ropes from yellowish fangs\n\nIt was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and Harry\nknew that the only reason they werent already dead was that their\nsudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting\nover that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant\n\nHarry groped for the doorknob    between Filch and death hed take\nFilch\n\nThey fell backward    Harry slammed the door shut and they ran they\nalmost flew back down the corridor Filch must have hurried off to look\nfor them somewhere else because they didnt see him anywhere but they\nhardly cared    all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible\nbetween them and that monster They didnt stop running until they\nreached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor\n\nWhere on earth have you all been she asked looking at their\nbathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces\n\nNever mind that    pig snout pig snout panted Harry and the\nportrait swung forward They scrambled into the common room and\ncollapsed trembling into armchairs\n\nIt was a while before any of them said anything Neville indeed looked\nas if hed never speak again\n\nWhat do they think theyre doing keeping a thing like that locked up\nin a school said Ron finally If any dog needs exercise that one\ndoes\n\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again You\ndont use your eyes any of you do you she snapped Didnt you see\nwhat it was standing on\n\nThe floor Harry suggested I wasnt looking at its feet I was too\nbusy with its heads\n\nNo not the floor It was standing on a trapdoor Its obviously\nguarding something\n\nShe stood up glaring at them\n\nI hope youre pleased with yourselves We could all have been killed   \nor worse expelled Now if you dont mind Im going to bed\n\nRon stared after her his mouth open\n\nNo we dont mind he said Youd think we dragged her along\nwouldnt you\n\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed\nback into bed The dog was guarding something What had Hagrid said\nGringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to\nhide    except perhaps Hogwarts\n\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package\nfrom vault seven hundred and thirteen was\n\n\n",
    " TEN\n\nHALLOWEEN\n\nMalfoy couldnt believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were\nstill at Hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful\nIndeed by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the\nthree headed dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite\nkeen to have another one In the meantime Harry filled Ron in about the\npackage that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts and\nthey spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy\nprotection Its either really valuable or really dangerous said Ron\nOr both said Harry\n\n\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it\nwas about two inches long they didnt have much chance of guessing what\nit was without further clues\n\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay\nunderneath the dog and the trapdoor All Neville cared about was never\ngoing near the dog again\n\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron but she was such a\nbossy know it all that they saw this as an added bonus All they really\nwanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy and to their great\ndelight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later\n\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual everyones attention\nwas caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech\nowls Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in\nthis large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped\nit right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor They had\nhardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top\nof the parcel\n\nHarry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said\n\n\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE\n\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand but I dont want everybody\nknowing youve got a broomstick or theyll all want one Oliver Wood\nwill meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven oclock for your\nfirst training session\n\nProfessor McGonagall\n\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to\nread\n\nA Nimbus Two Thousand Ron moaned enviously Ive never even touched\none\n\nThey left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private\nbefore their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they\nfound the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle Malfoy seized the\npackage from Harry and felt it\n\nThats a broomstick he said throwing it back to Harry with a mixture\nof jealousy and spite on his face Youll be in for it this time\nPotter first years arent allowed them\n\nRon couldnt resist it\n\nIts not any old broomstick he said its a Nimbus Two Thousand\nWhat did you say youve got at home Malfoy a Comet Two Sixty Ron\ngrinned at Harry Comets look flashy but theyre not in the same\nleague as the Nimbus\n\nWhat would you know about it Weasley you couldnt afford half the\nhandle Malfoy snapped back I suppose you and your brothers have to\nsave up twig by twig\n\nBefore Ron could answer Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoys elbow\n\nNot arguing I hope boys he squeaked\n\nPotters been sent a broomstick Professor said Malfoy quickly\n\nYes yes thats right said Professor Flitwick beaming at Harry\nProfessor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances\nPotter And what model is it\n\nA Nimbus Two Thousand sit said Harry fighting not to laugh at the\nlook of horror on Malfoys face And its really thanks to Malfoy here\nthat Ive got it he added\n\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at Malfoys\nobvious rage and confusion Well its true Harry chortled as they\nreached the top of the marble staircase If he hadnt stolen Nevilles\nRemembrall I woulnt be on the team\n\nSo I suppose you think thats a reward for breaking rules came an\nangry voice from just behind them Hermione was stomping up the stairs\nlooking disapprovingly at the package in Harrys hand\n\nI thought you werent speaking to us said Harry\n\nYes dont stop now said Ron its doing us so much good\n\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air\n\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day It\nkept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying\nunder his bed or straying off to the Quidditch field where hed be\nlearning to play that night He bolted his dinner that evening without\nnoticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap\nthe Nimbus Two Thousand at last\n\nWow Ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto Harrys bedspread\n\nEven Harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it\nlooked wonderful Sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long\ntail of neat straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold\nnear the top\n\nAs seven oclock drew nearer Harry left the castle and set off in the\ndusk toward the Quidditch field Held never been inside the stadium\nbefore Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that\nthe spectators were high enough to see what was going on At either end\nof the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end They\nreminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle\n\nchildren blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high\n\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood Harry mounted his broomstick\nand kicked off from the ground What a feeling    he swooped in and out\nof the goal posts and then sped up and down the field The Nimbus Two\nThousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch\n\nHey Potter come down\n\nOliver Wood had arrived fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his\narm Harry landed next to him\n\nVery nice said Wood his eyes glinting I see what McGonagall\nmeant you really are a natural Im just going to teach you the rules\nthis evening then youll be joining team practice three times a week\n\nHe opened the crate Inside were four different sized balls\n\nRight said Wood Now Quidditch is easy enough to understand even\nif its not too easy to play There are seven players on each side\nThree of them are called Chasers\n\nThree Chasers Harry repeated as Wood took out a bright red ball\nabout the size of a soccer ball\n\nThis balls called the Quaffle said Wood The Chasers throw the\nQuaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to\nscore a goal Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the\nhoops Follow me\n\nThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score\nHarry recited So    thats sort of like basketball on broomsticks with\nsix hoops isnt it\n\nWhats basketball said Wood curiously Never mind said Harry\nquickly\n\nNow theres another player on each side whos called the Keeper  Im\nKeeper for Gryffindor I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other\nteam from scoring\n\nThree Chasers one Keeper said Harry who was determined to remember\nit all And they play with the Quaffle Okay got that So what are\nthey for He pointed at the three balls left inside the box\n\nIll show you now said Wood Take this\n\nHe handed Harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat\n\nIm going to show you what the Bludgers do Wood said These two are\nthe Bludgers\n\nHe showed Harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than\nthe red Quaffle Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to\nescape the straps holding them inside the box\n\nStand back Wood warned Harry He bent down and freed one of the\nBludgers\n\nAt once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\nHarrys face Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking\nhis nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air    it zoomed around\ntheir heads and then shot at Wood who dived on top of it and managed to\npin it to the ground\n\nSee Wood panted forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate\nand strapping it down safely The Bludgers rocket around trying to\nknock players off their brooms Thats why you have two Beaters on each\nteam    the Weasley twins are ours    its their job to protect their\nside from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team So\n   think youve got all that\n\nThree Chasers try and score with the Quaffle the Keeper guards the\ngoal posts the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team Harry\nreeled off\n\nVery good said Wood\n\nEr    have the Bludgers ever killed anyone Harry asked hoping he\nsounded offhand\n\nNever at Hogwarts Weve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse\nthan that Now the last member of the team is the\n\nSeeker Thats you And you dont have to worry about the Quaffle or the\nBludgers unless they crack my head open\n\nDont worry the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers    I\nmean theyre like a pair of human Bludgers themselves\n\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball\nCompared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers it was tiny about the size\nof a large walnut It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver\nwings\n\nThis said Wood is the Golden Snitch and its the most important\nball of the lot Its very hard to catch because its so fast and\ndifficult to see Its the Seekers job to catch it Youve got to weave\nin and out of the Chasers Beaters Bludgers and Quaffle to get it\nbefore the other teams Seeker because whichever Seeker catches the\nSnitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they\n\nnearly always win Thats why Seekers get fouled so much A game of\nQuidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught so it can go on for ages\n   I think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on\nsubstitutes so the players could get some sleep Well thats it    any\nquestions\n\nHarry shook his head He understood what he had to do all right it was\ndoing it that was going to be the problem\n\nWe wont practice with the Snitch yet said Wood carefully shutting\nit back inside the crate its too dark we might lose it Lets try\nyou out with a few of these\n\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\nminutes later he and Harry were up in the air Wood throwing the golf\nballs as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch\n\nHarry didnt miss a single one and Wood was delighted After half an\nhour night had really fallen and they couldnt carry on\n\nThat Quidditch cupll have our name on it this year said Wood happily\nas they trudged back up to the castle I wouldnt be surprised if you\nturn out better than Charlie Weasley and he could have played for\nEngland if he hadnt gone off chasing dragons\n\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy what with Quidditch practice\nthree evenings a week on top of all his homework but Harry could hardly\nbelieve it when he realized that hed already been at Hogwarts two\nmonths The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had His\nlessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had\nmastered the basics\n\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin\nwafting through the corridors Even better Professor Flitwick announced\nin Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly\nsomething they had all been dying to try since theyd seen him make\nNevilles toad zoom around the classroom Professor Flitwick put the\nclass into pairs to practice Harrys partner was Seamus Finnigan which\nwas a relief because Neville had been trying to catch his eye Ron\nhowever was to be working with Hermione Granger It was hard to tell\nwhether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this She hadnt spoken to\neither of them since the day Harrys broomstick had arrived\n\nNow dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been practicing\nsqueaked Professor Flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as\nusual Swish and flick remember swish and flick And saying the magic\nwords properly is very important too    never forget Wizard Baruffio\nwho said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a\nbuffalo on his chest\n\nIt was very difficult Harry and Seamus swished and flicked but the\nfeather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the\ndesktop Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and\nset fire to it    Harry had to put it out with his hat\n\nRon at the next table wasnt having much more luck\n\nWingardium Leviosa he shouted waving his long arms like a windmill\n\nYoure saying it wrong Harry heard Hermione snap Its Wing gar dium\nLevi o sa make the gar nice and long\n\n\nYou do it then if youre so clever Ron snarled\n\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said\nWingardium Leviosa\n\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their\nheads\n\nOh well done cried Professor Flitwick clapping Everyone see here\nMiss Grangers done it\n\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class Its no wonder no\none can stand her he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the\ncrowded corridor shes a nightmare honestly \n\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him It was Hermione\nHarry caught a glimpse of her face    and was startled to see that she\nwas in tears\n\nI think she heard you\n\nSo said Ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable She mustve noticed\nshes got no friends\n\nHermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt seen all\nafternoon On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast\nHarry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that\nHermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone\nRon looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had\nentered the Great Hall where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out\nof their minds\n\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a\nthousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the\ncandles in the pumpkins stutter The feast appeared suddenly on the\ngolden plates as it had at the start of term banquet\n\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell\ncame sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face\nEveryone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledores chair slumped\nagainst the table and gasped Troll    in the dungeons    thought you\nought to know\n\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint\n\nThere was an uproar It took several purple firecrackers exploding from\nthe end of Professor Dumbledores wand to bring silence\n\nPrefects he rumbled lead your Houses back to the dormitories\nimmediately\n\nPercy was in his element\n\nFollow me Stick together first years No need to fear the troll if\nyou follow my orders Stay close behind me now Make way first years\ncoming through Excuse me Im a prefect\n\nHow could a troll get in Harry asked as they climbed the stairs\n\nDont ask me theyre supposed to be really stupid said Ron Maybe\nPeeves let it in for a Halloween joke\n\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions\nAs they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs Harry\nsuddenly grabbed Rons arm\n\nIve just thought    Hermione\n\nWhat about her\n\nShe doesnt know about the troll\n\nRon bit his lip\n\nOh all right he snapped But Percyd better not see us\n\nDucking down they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way slipped\ndown a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls\nbathroom They had just turned the corner when they heard quick\nfootsteps behind them\n\nPercy hissed Ron pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin\n\nPeering around it however they saw not Percy but Snape He crossed the\ncorridor and disappeared from view\n\nWhats he doing Harry whispered Why isnt he down in the dungeons\nwith the rest of the teachers\n\nSearch me\n\nQuietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after Snapes\nfading footsteps\n\nHes heading for the third floor Harry said but Ron held up his\nhand\n\nCan you smell something\n\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old\nsocks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean\n\nAnd then they heard it    a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of\ngigantic feet Ron pointed    at the end of a passage to the left\nsomething huge was moving toward them They shrank into the shadows and\nwatched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight\n\nIt was a horrible sight Twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite\ngray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head\nperched on top like a coconut It had short legs thick as tree trunks\nwith flat horny feet The smell coming from it was incredible It was\nholding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its\narms were so long\n\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside It waggled its\nlong ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room\n\nThe keys in the lock Harry muttered We could lock it in\n\nGood idea said Ron nervously\n\nThey edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasnt\nabout to come out of it With one great leap Harry managed to grab the\nkey slam the door and lock it\n\nYes\n\nFlushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but\nas they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts\nstop    a high petrified scream    and it was coming from the chamber\ntheyd just chained up\n\nOh no said Ron pale as the Bloody Baron\n\nIts the girls bathroom Harry gasped\n\nHermione they said together\n\nIt was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have\nWheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key\nfumbling in their panic Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside\n\nHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if\nshe was about to faint The troll was advancing on her knocking the\nsinks off the walls as it went\n\nConfuse it Harry said desperately to Ron and seizing a tap he\nthrew it as hard as he could against the wall\n\nThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione It lumbered around blinking\nstupidly to see what had made the noise Its mean little eyes saw\nHarry It hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it\nwent\n\nOy pea brain yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber and he\nthrew a metal pipe at it The troll didnt even seem to notice the pipe\nhitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning\nits ugly snout toward Ron instead giving Harry time to run around it\n\nCome on run run Harry yelled at Hermione trying to pull her toward\nthe door but she couldnt move she was still flat against the wall\nher mouth open with terror\n\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk It\nroared again and started toward Ron who was nearest and had no way to\nescape\n\nHarry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid He\ntook a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the\ntrolls neck from behind The troll couldnt feel Harry hanging there\nbut even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its\nnose and Harrys wand had still been in his hand when hed jumped    it\nhad gone straight up one of the trolls nostrils\n\nHowling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with Harry\nclinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him\noff or catch him a terrible blow with the club\n\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright Ron pulled out his own wand   \nnot knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell\nthat came into his head Wingardium Leviosa\n\nThe club flew suddenly out of the trolls hand rose high high up into\nthe air turned slowly over    and dropped with a sickening crack onto\nits owners head The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its\nface with a thud that made the whole room tremble\n\nHarry got to his feet He was shaking and out of breath Ron was\nstanding there with his wand still raised staring at what he had done\n\nIt was Hermione who spoke first\n\nIs it    dead\n\nI dont think so said Harry I think its just been knocked out\n\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls nose It was covered\nin what looked like lumpy gray glue\n\nUrgh    troll boogers\n\nHe wiped it on the trolls trousers\n\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up\nThey hadnt realized what a racket they had been making but of course\nsomeone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trolls roars A\nmoment later Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room\nclosely followed by Snape with Quirrell bringing up the rear Quirrell\ntook one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly\ndown on a toilet clutching his heart\n\nSnape bent over the troll Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and\nHarry Harry had never seen her look so angry Her lips were white\nHopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harrys\nmind\n\nWhat on earth were you thinking of said Professor McGonagall with\ncold fury in her voice Harry looked at Ron who was still standing with\nhis wand in the air Youre lucky you werent killed Why arent you in\nyour dormitory\n\nSnape gave Harry a swift piercing look Harry looked at the floor He\nwished Ron would put his wand down\n\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows\n\nPlease Professor McGonagall    they were looking for me\n\nMiss Granger\n\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last\n\nI went looking for the troll because I    I thought I could deal with it\non my own    you know because Ive read all about them\n\nRon dropped his wand Hermione Granger telling a downright lie to a\nteacher If they hadnt found me Id be dead now Harry stuck his wand\nup its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club They didnt have\ntime to come and fetch anyone It was about to finish me off when they\narrived\n\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasnt new to them\n\nWell    in that case said Professor McGonagall staring at the\nthree of them Miss Granger you foolish girl how could you think of\ntackling a mountain troll on your own\n\nHermione hung her head Harry was speechless Hermione was the last\nperson to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending\nshe had to get them out of trouble It was as if Snape had started\nhanding out sweets\n\nMiss Granger five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this said\nProfessor McGonagall Im very disappointed in you If youre not hurt\nat all youd better get off to Gryffindor tower Students are finishing\nthe feast in their houses\n\nHermione left\n\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron\n\nWell I still say you were lucky but not many first years could have\ntaken on a full grown mountain troll You each win Gryffindor five\npoints Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this You may go\n\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didnt speak at all until they had\nclimbed two floors up It was a relief to be away from the smell of the\ntroll quite apart from anything else\n\nWe should have gotten more than ten points Ron grumbled\n\nFive you mean once shes taken off Hermiones\n\nGood of her to get us out of trouble like that Ron admitted Mind\nyou we did save her\n\nShe might not have needed saving if we hadnt locked the thing in with\nher Harry reminded him\n\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady\n\nPig snout they said and entered\n\nThe common room was packed and noisy Everyone was eating the food that\nhad been sent up Hermione however stood alone by the door waiting\nfor them There was a very embarrassed pause Then none of them looking\nat each other they all said Thanks and hurried off to get plates\n\nBut from that moment on Hermione Granger became their friend There are\nsome things you cant share without ending up liking each other and\nknocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them\n\n\n",
    " ELEVEN\n\nQUIDDITCH\n\nAs they entered November the weather turned very cold The mountains\naround the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel Every\nmorning the ground was covered in frost Hagrid could be seen from the\nupstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field bundled\nup in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous\nbeaverskin boots\n\nThe Quidditch season had begun On Saturday Harry would be playing in\nhis first match after weeks of training Gryffindor versus Slytherin If\nGryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house\nchampionship\n\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that as\ntheir secret weapon Harry should be kept well secret But the news\nthat he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow and Harry didnt know\nwhich was worse    people telling him hed be brilliant or people\ntelling him theyd be running around underneath him holding a mattress\n\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend He didnt\nknow how hed have gotten through all his homework without her what\nwith all the last minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do She\nhad also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages which turned out to be a\nvery interesting read\n\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\nQuidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup\nmatch in 1473 that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest\nplayers and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to\nthem that although people rarely died playing Quidditch referees had\nbeen known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert\n\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry\nand Ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer\nfor it The day before Harrys first Quidditch match the three of them\nwere out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured\nthem up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar\nThey were standing with their backs to it getting warm when Snape\ncrossed the yard Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping Harry\nRon and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view\nthey were sure it wouldnt be allowed Unfortunately something about\ntheir guilty faces caught Snapes eye He limped over He hadnt seen\nthe fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off\nanyway\n\nWhats that youve got there Potter\n\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages Harry showed him\n\nLibrary books are not to be taken outside the school said Snape\nGive it to me Five points from Gryffindor\n\nHes just made that rule up Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped\naway Wonder whats wrong with his leg\n\nDunno but I hope its really hurting him said Ron bitterly\n\nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening Harry Ron and\nHermione sat together next to a window Hermione was checking Harry and\nRons Charms homework for them She would never let them copy How will\nyou learn but by asking her to read it through they got the right\nanswers anyway\n\nHarry felt restless He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back to take\nhis mind off his nerves about tomorrow Why should he be afraid of\nSnape Getting up he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if\nhe could have it\n\nBetter you than me they said together but Harry had an idea that\nSnape wouldnt refuse if there were other teachers listening\n\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked There was no answer\nHe knocked again Nothing\n\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there It was worth a try He pushed\nthe door ajar and peered inside    and a horrible scene met his eyes\n\nSnape and Filch were inside alone Snape was holding his robes above\nhis knees One of his legs was bloody and mangled Filch was handing\nSnape bandages\n\nBlasted thing Snape was saying How are you supposed to keep your\neyes on all three heads at once\n\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly but   \n\nPOTTER\n\nSnapes face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to\nhide his leg Harry gulped\n\nI just wondered if I could have my book back\n\nGET OUT OUT\n\nHarry left before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor He\nsprinted back upstairs\n\nDid you get it Ron asked as Harry joined them Whats the matter\n\nIn a low whisper Harry told them what hed seen\n\nYou know what this means he finished breathlessly He tried to get\npast that three headed dog at Halloween Thats where he was going when\nwe saw him    hes after whatever its guarding And Id bet my\nbroomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion\n\nHermiones eyes were wide\n\nNo    he wouldnt she said I know hes not very nice but he\nwouldnt try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe\n\nHonestly Hermione you think all teachers are saints or something\nsnapped Ron Im with Harry I wouldnt put anything past Snape But\nwhats he after Whats that dog guarding\n\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question Neville\nwas snoring loudly but Harry couldnt sleep He tried to empty his mind\n   he needed to sleep he had to he had his first Quidditch match in a\nfew hours    but the expression on Snapes face when Harry had seen his\nleg wasnt easy to forget\n\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold The Great Hall was full of\nthe delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of\neveryone looking forward to a good Quidditch match\n\nYouve got to eat some breakfast\n\nI dont want anything\n\nJust a bit of toast wheedled Hermione\n\nIm not hungry\n\nHarry felt terrible In an hours time hed be walking onto the field\n\nHarry you need your strength said Seamus Finnigan Seekers are\nalways the ones who get clobbered by the other team\n\nThanks Seamus said Harry watching Seamus pile ketchup on his\nsausages\n\nBy eleven oclock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around\nthe Quidditch pitch Many students had binoculars The seats might be\nraised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going\non sometimes\n\nRon and Hermione joined Neville Seamus and Dean the West Ham fan up in\nthe top row As a surprise for Harry they had painted a large banner on\none of the sheets Scabbers had ruined It said Potter for President and\nDean who was good at drawing had done a large Gryffindor lion\nunderneath Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that\nthe paint flashed different colors\n\nMeanwhile in the locker room Harry and the rest of the team were\nchanging into their scarlet Quidditch robes Slytherin would be playing\nin green\n\nWood cleared his throat for silence\n\nOkay men he said\n\nAnd women said Chaser Angelina Johnson\n\nAnd women Wood agreed This is it\n\nThe big one said Fred Weasley\n\nThe one weve all been waiting for said George\n\nWe know Olivers speech by heart Fred told Harry we were on the\nteam last year\n\nShut up you two said Wood This is the best team Gryffindors had\nin years Were going to win I know it\n\nHe glared at them all as if to say Or else\n\nRight Its time Good luck all of you\n\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and hoping his\nknees werent going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheers\n\nMadam Hooch was refereeing She stood in the middle of the field waiting\nfor the two teams her broom in her hand\n\nNow I want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all\ngathered around her Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking\nparticularly to the Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint a sixth year Harry\nthought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him Out of the\ncorner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing\nPotter for President over the crowd His heart skipped He felt braver\n\nMount your brooms please\n\nHarry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand\n\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle\n\nFifteen brooms rose up high high into the air They were off And the\nQuaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor    what\nan excellent Chaser that girl is and rather attractive too   \n\nJORDAN\n\nSorry Professor\n\nThe Weasley twins friend Lee Jordan was doing the commentary for the\nmatch closely watched by Professor McGonagall\n\nAnd shes really belting along up there a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet\na good find of Oliver Woods last year only a reserve    back to\nJohnson and    no the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle Slytherin\nCaptain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes    Flint flying\nlike an eagle up there    hes going to sc  no stopped by an excellent\nmove by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle   \nthats Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there nice dive around Flint\noff up the field and    OUCH    that must have hurt hit in the back of\nthe head by a Bludger    Quaffle taken by the Slytherins    thats\nAdrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts but hes blocked by a\nsecond Bludger    sent his way by Fred or George Weasley cant tell\nwhich    nice play by the Gryffindor Beater anyway and Johnson back in\npossession of the Quaffle a clear field ahead and off she goes    shes\nreally flying    dodges a speeding Bludger    the goal posts are ahead\n   come on now Angelina    Keeper Bletchley dives    misses   \nGRYFFINDORS SCORE\n\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the\nSlytherins\n\nBudge up there move along\n\nHagrid\n\nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join\nthem\n\nBin watchin from me hut said Hagrid patting a large pair of\nbinoculars around his neck But it isnt the same as bein in the\ncrowd No sign of the Snitch yet eh\n\nNope said Ron Harry hasnt had much to do yet\n\nKept outta trouble though thats somethin said Hagrid raising his\nbinoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry\n\nWay up above them Harry was gliding over the game squinting about for\nsome sign of the Snitch This was part of his and Woods game plan\n\nKeep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch Wood had\nsaid We dont want you attacked before you have to be\n\nWhen Angelina had scored Harry had done a couple of loop the loops to\nlet off his feelings Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch\nOnce he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection\nfrom one of the Weasleys wristwatches and once a Bludger decided to\ncome pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but Harry\ndodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it\n\nAll right there Harry he had time to yell as he beat the Bludger\nfuriously toward Marcus Flint\n\nSlytherin in possession Lee Jordan was saying Chaser Pucey ducks\ntwo Bludgers two Weasleys and Chaser Bell and speeds toward the   \nwait a moment    was that the Snitch\n\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle too\nbusy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his\nleft ear\n\nHarry saw it In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the\nstreak of gold Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it too Neck\nand neck they hurtled toward the Snitch  all the Chasers seemed to have\nforgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to\nwatch\n\nHarry was faster than Higgs    he could see the little round ball wings\nfluttering darting up ahead     he put on an extra spurt of speed   \n\nWHAM A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below    Marcus Flint\nhad blocked Harry on purpose and Harrys broom spun off course Harry\nholding on for dear life\n\nFoul screamed the Gryffindors\n\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the\ngoal posts for Gryffindor But in all the confusion of course the\nGolden Snitch had disappeared from sight again\n\nDown in the stands Dean Thomas was yelling Send him off ref Red\ncard\n\nWhat are you talking about Dean said Ron\n\nRed card said Dean furiously In soccer you get shown the red card\nand youre out of the game\n\nBut this isnt soccer Dean Ron reminded him\n\nHagrid however was on Deans side\n\nThey oughta change the rules Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the\nair\n\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides\n\nSo    after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating\n\nJordan growled Professor McGonagall\n\nI mean after that open and revolting foul\n\nJordan Im warning you   \n\nAll right all right Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker which\ncould happen to anyone Im sure so a penalty to Gryffindor taken by\nSpinner who puts it away no trouble and we continue play Gryffindor\nstill in possession\n\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger which went spinning dangerously\npast his head that it happened His broom gave a sudden frightening\nlurch For a split second he thought he was going to fall He gripped\nthe broom tightly with both his hands and knees Hed never felt\nanything like that\n\nIt happened again It was as though the broom was trying to buck him\noff But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their\nriders off Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal  posts\n   he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time out    and then he\nrealized that his broom was completely out of his control He couldnt\nturn it He couldnt direct it at all It was zigzagging through the\nair and every now and then making violent swishing movements that\nalmost unseated him\n\nLee was still commentating\n\nSlytherin in possession    Flint with the Quaffle    passes Spinnet   \npasses Bell    hit hard in the face by a Bludger hope it broke his nose\n   only joking Professor    Slytherins score    A no\n\nThe Slytherins were cheering No one seemed to have noticed that Harrys\nbroom was behaving strangely It was carrying  him slowly higher away\nfrom the game jerking and twitching as it went\n\nDunno what Harry thinks hes doing Hagrid mumbled He stared through\nhis binoculars If I didn know better Id say hed lost control of\nhis broom but he cant have\n\nSuddenly people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands His\nbroom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to\nhold on Then the whole crowd gasped Harrys broom had given a wild\njerk and Harry swung off it He was now dangling from it holding on\nwith only one hand\n\nDid something happen to it when Flint blocked him Seamus whispered\n\nCant have Hagrid said his voice shaking Cant nothing interfere\nwith a broomstick except powerful Dark magic    no kid could do that to\na Nimbus Two Thousand\n\nAt these words Hermione seized Hagrids binoculars but instead of\nlooking up at Harry she started looking frantically at the crowd\n\nWhat are you doing moaned Ron gray faced\n\nI knew it Hermione gasped Snape    look\n\nRon grabbed the binoculars Snape was in the middle of the stands\nopposite them He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop\nunder his breath\n\nHes doing something    jinxing the broom said Hermione\n\nWhat should we do\n\nLeave it to me\n\nBefore Ron could say another word Hermione had disappeared Ron turned\nthe binoculars back on Harry His broom was vibrating so hard it was\nalmost impossible for him to hang on much longer The whole crowd was on\nits feet watching terrified as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull\nHarry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good    every time\nthey got near him the broom would jump higher still They dropped lower\nand circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell\nMarcus\n\nFlint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing\n\nCome on Hermione Ron muttered desperately\n\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood and\nwas now racing along the row behind him she didnt even stop to say\nsorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front\nReaching Snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a\nfew well  chosen words Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the\nhem of Snapes robes\n\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire\nA sudden yelp told her she had done her job Scooping the fire off him\ninto a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row   \nSnape would never know what had happened\n\nIt was enough Up in the air Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on\nto his broom\n\nNeville you can look Ron said Neville had been sobbing into\nHagrids jacket for the last five minutes\n\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his\nhand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick    he hit the field\non all fours    coughed    and something gold fell into his hand\n\nIve got the Snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the\ngame ended in complete confusion\n\nHe didnt catch it he nearly swallowed it Flint was still howling\ntwenty minutes later but it made no difference    Harry hadnt broken\nany rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results   \nGryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty Harry\nheard none of this though He was being made a cup of strong tea back\nin Hagrids hut with Ron and Hermione\n\nIt was Snape Ron was explaining Hermione and I saw him He was\ncursing your broomstick muttering he wouldnt take his eyes off you\n\nRubbish said Hagrid who hadnt heard a word of what had gone on next\nto him in the stands Why would Snape do somethin like that\n\nHarry Ron and Hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell\nhim Harry decided on the truth\n\nI found out something about him he told Hagrid He tried to get past\nthat three headed dog on Halloween It bit him We think he was trying\nto steal whatever its guarding\n\nHagrid dropped the teapot\n\nHow do you know about Fluffy he said\n\nFluffy\n\nYeah    hes mine    bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub\nlas year    I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the\n\nYes said Harry eagerly\n\nNow dont ask me anymore said Hagrid gruffly Thats top secret\nthat is\n\nBut Snapes trying to steal it\n\nRubbish said Hagrid again Snapes a Hogwarts teacher hed do\nnothin of the sort\n\nSo why did he just try and kill Harry cried Hermione\n\nThe afternoons events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about\nSnape\n\nI know a jinx when I see one Hagrid Ive read all about them\n\nYouve got to keep eye contact and Snape wasnt blinking at all I saw\nhim\n\nIm tellin yeh yer wrong said Hagrid hotly I don know why\nHarrys broom acted like that but Snape wouldn try an kill a student\nNow listen to me all three of yeh    yer meddlin in things that don\nconcern yeh Its dangerous You forget that dog an you forget what\nits guardin thats between Professor Dumbledore an Nicolas Flamel\n  \n\nAha said Harry so theres someone called Nicolas Flamel involved\nis there\n\nHagrid looked furious with himself\n\n\n",
    " TWELVE\n\nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED\n\nChristmas was coming One morning in mid December Hogwarts woke to find\nitself covered in several feet of snow The lake froze solid and the\nWeasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that\nthey followed Quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban The\nfew owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to\ndeliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could\nfly off again\n\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start While the Gryffindor common\nroom and the Great Hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had\nbecome icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms\nWorst of all were Professor Snapes classes down in the dungeons where\ntheir breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as\npossible to their hot cauldrons\n\nI do feel so sorry said Draco Malfoy one Potions class for all\nthose people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because theyre\nnot wanted at home\n\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke Crabbe and Goyle chuckled\nHarry who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish ignored them\nMalfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch\nmatch Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost he had tried to get\neveryone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing\nHarry as Seeker next Then hed realized that nobody found this funny\nbecause they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay\non his bucking broomstick So Malfoy jealous and angry had gone back\nto taunting Harry about having no proper family\n\nIt was true that Harry wasnt going back to Privet Drive for Christmas\nProfessor McGonagall had come around the week before making a list of\nstudents who would be staying for the holidays and Harry had signed up\nat once He didnt feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be\nthe best Christmas hed ever had Ron and his brothers were staying\ntoo because Mr and Mrs Weasley were going to Romania to visit\nCharlie\n\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions they found a large\nfir tree blocking the corridor ahead Two enormous feet sticking out at\nthe bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it\n\nHi Hagrid want any help Ron asked sticking his head through the\nbranches\n\nNah Im all right thanks Ron\n\nWould you mind moving out of the way came Malfoys cold drawl from\nbehind them Are you trying to earn some extra money Weasley Hoping\nto be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts I suppose    that hut\nof Hagrids must seem like a palace compared to what your familys used\nto\n\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs\n\nWEASLEY\n\nRon let go of the front of Malfoys robes\n\nHe was provoked Professor Snape said Hagrid sticking his huge hairy\nface out from behind the tree Malfoy was insultin his family\n\nBe that as it may fighting is against Hogwarts rules Hagrid said\nSnape silkily Five points from Gryffindor Weasley and be grateful it\nisnt more Move along all of you\n\nMalfoy Crabbe and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering\nneedles everywhere and smirking\n\nIll get him said Ron grinding his teeth at Malfoys back one of\nthese days Ill get him   \n\nI hate them both said Harry Malfoy and Snape\n\nCome on cheer up its nearly Christmas said Hagrid Tell yeh what\ncome with me an see the Great Hall looks a treat\n\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to  the Great\nHall where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with\nthe Christmas decorations\n\nAh Hagrid the last tree    put it in the far corner would you\n\nThe hall looked spectacular Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all\naround the walls and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood\naround the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with\nhundreds of candles\n\nHow many days you got left until yer holidays Hagrid asked\n\nJust one said Hermione And that reminds me  Harry Ron weve got\nhalf an hour before lunch we should be in the library\n\nOh yeah youre right said Ron tearing his eyes away from Professor\nFlitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was\ntrailing them over the branches of the new tree\n\nThe library said Hagrid following them out of the hall Just before\nthe holidays Bit keen arent yeh\n\nOh were not working Harry told him brightly Ever since you\nmentioned Nicolas Flamel weve been trying to find out who he is\n\nYou what Hagrid looked shocked Listen here    Ive told yeh    drop\nit Its nothin to you what that dogs guardin\n\nWe just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is thats all said Hermione\n\nUnless youd like to tell us and save us the trouble Harry added We\nmustve been through hundreds of books already and we cant find him\nanywhere    just give us a hint    I know Ive read his name somewhere\n\nIm sayin nothin said Hagrid flatly\n\nJust have to find out for ourselves then said Ron and they left\nHagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library\n\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamels name ever since Hagrid\nhad let it slip because how else were they going to find out what Snape\nwas trying to steal The trouble was it was very hard to know where to\nbegin not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a\nbook He wasnt in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century or Notable\nMagical Names of Our Time he was missing too from Important Modern\nMagical Discoveries and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry And\nthen of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of\nthousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows\n\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to\nsearch while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them\noff the shelves at random Harry wandered over to the Restricted\nSection He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasnt somewhere in\nthere Unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the\nteachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew hed never\nget one These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never\ntaught at Hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced\nDefense Against the Dark Arts\n\nWhat are you looking for boy\n\nNothing said Harry\n\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him\n\nYoud better get out then Go on    out\n\nWishing hed been a bit quicker at thinking up some story Harry left\nthe library He Ron and Hermione had already agreed theyd better not\nask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel They were sure shed be\nable to tell them but they couldnt risk Snape hearing what they were\nup to\n\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\nanything but he wasnt very hopeful They had been looking for two\nweeks after A but as they only had odd moments between lessons it\nwasnt surprising theyd found nothing What they really needed was a\nnice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks\n\nFive minutes later Ron and Hermione joined him shaking their heads\nThey went off to lunch\n\nYou will keep looking while Im away wont you said Hermione And\nsend me an owl if you find anything\n\nAnd you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is said Ron\nItd be safe to ask them\n\nVery safe as theyre both dentists said Hermione\n\nOnce the holidays had started Ron and Harry were having too good a time\nto think much about Flamel They had the dormitory to themselves and the\ncommon room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the\ngood armchairs by the fire They sat by the hour eating anything they\ncould spear on a toasting fork    bread English muffins marshmallows\n   and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled which were fun to talk\nabout even if they wouldnt work\n\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess This was exactly like\nMuggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot\nlike directing troops in battle Rons set was very old and battered\nLike everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in\nhis family    in this case his grandfather However old chessmen\nwerent a drawback at all Ron knew them so well he never had trouble\ngetting them to do what he wanted\n\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him and they didnt\ntrust him at all He wasnt a very good player yet and they kept\nshouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing Dont\nsend me there cant you see his knight Send him we can afford to lose\nhim On Christmas Eve Harry went to bed looking forward to the next\nday for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all\nWhen he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a\nsmall pile of packages at the foot of his bed\n\nMerry Christmas said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\npulled on his bathrobe\n\nYou too said Harry Will you look at this Ive got some presents\n\nWhat did you expect turnips said Ron turning to his own pile which\nwas a lot bigger than Harrys\n\nHarry picked up the top parcel It was wrapped in thick brown paper and\nscrawled across it was To Harry from Hagrid Inside was a roughly cut\nwooden flute Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself Harry blew it   \nit sounded a bit like an owl\n\nA second very small parcel contained a note\n\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas present From Uncle\nVernon and Aunt Petunia Taped to the note was a fifty pence piece\n\nThats friendly said Harry\n\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence\n\nWeird he said NMat a shape This is money\n\nYou can keep it said Harry laughing at how pleased Ron was Hagrid\nand my aunt and uncle    so who sent these\n\nI think I know who that ones from said Ron turning a bit pink and\npointing to a very lumpy parcel My mom I told her you didnt expect\nany presents and    oh no he groaned shes made you a Weasley\nsweater\n\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick hand knitted sweater in\nemerald green and a large box of homemade fudge\n\nEvery year she makes us a sweater said Ron unwrapping his own and\nmines always maroon\n\nThats really nice of her said Harry trying the fudge which was\nvery tasty\n\nHis next present also contained candy    a large box of Chocolate Frogs\nfrom Hermione\n\nThis only left one parcel Harry picked it up and felt it It was very\nlight He unwrapped it\n\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it\nlay in gleaming folds Ron gasped\n\nIve heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of\nEvery Flavor Beans hed gotten from Hermione If thats what I think it\nis    theyre really rare and really valuable\n\nWhat is it\n\nHarry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor It was strange to\nthe touch like water woven into material\n\nIts an invisibility cloak said Ron a look of awe on his face Im\nsure it is    try it on\n\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell\n\nIt is Look down\n\nHarry looked down at his feet but they were gone He dashed to the\nmirror Sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head\nsuspended in midair his body completely invisible He pulled the cloak\nover his head and his reflection vanished completely\n\nTheres a note said Ron suddenly A note fell out of it\n\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter Written in narrow\nloopy writing he had never seen before were the following words Your\nfather left this in my possession before he died It is time it was\nreturned to you Use it well\n\nA Very Merry Christmas to you\n\n\nThere was no signature Harry stared at the note Ron was admiring the\ncloak\n\nId give anything for one of these he said Anything Whats the\nmatter\n\nNothing said Harry He felt very strange Who had sent the cloak Had\nit really once belonged to his father\n\nBefore he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung\nopen and Fred and George Weasley bounded in Harry stuffed the cloak\nquickly out of sight He didnt feel like sharing it with anyone else\nyet\n\nMerry Christmas\n\nHey look    Harrys got a Weasley sweater too\n\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow F on\nit the other a G\n\nHarrys is better than ours though said Fred holding up Harrys\nsweater She obviously makes more of an effort if youre not family\n\nWhy arent you wearing yours Ron George demanded Come on get it\non theyre lovely and warm\n\nI hate maroon Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head\n\nYou havent got a letter on yours George observed I suppose she\nthinks you dont forget your name But were not stupid    we know were\ncalled Gred and Forge\n\nWhats all th is noise\n\nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving He\nhad clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too\ncarried a lumpy sweater over his arm which\n\nFred seized\n\nP for prefect Get it on Percy come on were all wearing ours even\nHarry got one\n\nI    dont    want said Percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater\nover his head knocking his glasses askew\n\nAnd youre not sitting with the prefects today either said\n\nGeorge Christmas is a time for family\n\nThey frog marched Percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by\nhis sweater\n\nHarry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner A hundred\nfat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of\nchipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy\nand cranberry sauce    and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet\nalong the table These fantastic party favors were nothing like the\nfeeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought with their little\nplastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside Harry pulled a wizard\ncracker with Fred and it didnt just bang it went off with a blast like\na cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the\ninside exploded a rear admirals hat and several live white mice Up at\nthe High Table Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a\nflowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick\nhad just read him\n\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey Percy nearly broke his\nteeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice Harry watched Hagrid\ngetting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine\nfinally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek who to Harrys\namazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided\n\nWhen Harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of\nthings out of the crackers including a pack of nonexplodable luminous\nballoons a Grow Your Own Warts kit and his own new wizard chess set\nThe white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were\ngoing to end up as Mrs Norriss Christmas dinner\n\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball\nfight on the grounds Then cold wet and gasping for breath they\nreturned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room where Harry broke in\nhis new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron He suspected he\nwouldnt have lost so badly if Percy hadnt tried to help him so much\n\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and Christmas cake\neveryone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and\nwatch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because\ntheyd stolen his prefect badge\n\nIt had been Harrys best Christmas day ever Yet something had been\nnagging at the back of his mind all day Not until he climbed into bed\nwas he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had\nsent it\n\nRon full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him\nfell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn the curtains of his\nfour poster Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the\ncloak out from under it\n\nHis fathers this had been his fathers He let the material flow\nover his hands smoother than silk light as air Use it well the note\nhad said\n\nHe had to try it now He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak\naround himself Looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and\nshadows It was a very funny feeling\n\nUse it well\n\nSuddenly Harry felt wide awake The whole of Hogwarts was open to him\nin this cloak Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the\ndark and silence He could go anywhere in this anywhere and Filch\nwould never know\n\nRon grunted in his sleep Should Harry wake him Something held him back\n   his fathers cloak    he felt that this time    the first time    he\nwanted to use it alone\n\nHe crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room\nand climbed through the portrait hole\n\nWhos there squawked the Fat Lady Harry said nothing He walked\nquickly down the corridor\n\nWhere should he go He stopped his heart racing and thought And then\nit came to him The Restricted Section in the library Hed be able to\nread as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who Flamel was\nHe set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he\nwalked\n\nThe library was pitch black and very eerie Harry lit a lamp to see his\nway along the rows of books The lamp looked as if it was floating along\nin midair and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it the\nsight gave him the creeps\n\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library Step ping\ncarefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the\nlibrary he held up his lamp to read the titles\n\nThey didnt tell him much Their peeling faded gold letters spelled\nwords in languages Harry couldnt understand Some had no title at all\nOne book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood The\nhairs on the back of Harrys neck prickled Maybe he was imagining it\nmaybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books\nas though they knew someone was there who shouldnt be\n\nHe had to start somewhere Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor\nhe looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book A large\nblack and silver volume caught his eye He pulled it out with\ndifficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee\nlet it fall open\n\nA piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence    the book was\nscreaming Harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one\nhigh unbroken earsplitting note He stumbled backward and knocked over\nhis lamp which went out at once Panicking he heard footsteps coming\ndown the corridor outside    stuffing the shrieking book back on the\nshelf he ran for it He passed Filch in the doorway Filchs pale wild\neyes looked straight through him and Harry slipped under Filchs\noutstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the books shrieks\nstill ringing in his ears\n\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor He had been\nso busy getting away from the library he hadnt paid attention to where\nhe was going Perhaps because it was dark he didnt recognize where he\nwas at all There was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he\nmust be five floors above there\n\nYou asked me to come directly to you Professor if anyone was\nwandering around at night and somebodys been in the library Restricted\nSection\n\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face Wherever he was Filch must\nknow a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and\nto his horror it was Snape who replied The Restricted Section Well\nthey cant be far well catch them\n\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner\nahead They couldnt see him of course but it was a narrow corridor\nand if they came much nearer theyd knock right into him    the cloak\ndidnt stop him from being solid\n\nHe backed away as quietly as he could A door stood ajar to his left It\nwas his only hope He squeezed through it holding his breath trying\nnot to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room\nwithout their noticing anything They walked straight past and Harry\nleaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps\ndying away That had been close very close It was a few seconds before\nhe noticed anything about the room he had hidden in\n\nIt looked like an unused classroom The dark shapes of desks and chairs\nwere piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper\nbasket    but propped against the wall facing him was something that\ndidnt look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone\nhad just put it there to keep it out of the way\n\nIt was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold\nframe standing on two clawed feet There was an inscription carved\naround the top Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi His panic\nfading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape Harry moved\nnearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection\nagain He stepped in front of it\n\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming He\nwhirled around His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the\nbook had screamed    for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but\na whole crowd of people standing right behind him\n\nBut the room was empty Breathing very fast he turned slowly back to\nthe mirror\n\nThere he was reflected in it white and scared looking and there\nreflected behind him were at least ten others Harry looked over his\nshoulder    but still no one was there Or were they all invisible\ntoo Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors\ntrick was that it reflected them invisible or not\n\nHe looked in the mirror again A woman standing right behind his\nreflection was smiling at him and waving He reached out a hand and felt\nthe air behind him If she was really there hed touch her their\nreflections were so close together but he felt only air    she and the\nothers existed only in the mirror\n\nShe was a very pretty woman She had dark red hair and her eyes    her\neyes are just like mine Harry thought edging a little closer to the\nglass Bright green    exactly the same shape but then he noticed that\nshe was crying smiling but crying at the same time The tall thin\nblack haired man standing next to her put his arm around her He wore\nglasses and his hair was very untidy It stuck up at the back just as\nHarrys did\n\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching\nthat of his reflection\n\nMom he whispered Dad\n\nThey just looked at him smiling And slowly Harry looked into the\nfaces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green\neyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as\nthough he had Harrys knobbly knees    Harry was looking at his family\nfor the first time in his life\n\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at\nthem his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping\nto fall right through it and reach them He had a powerful kind of ache\ninside him half joy half terrible sadness\n\nHow long he stood there he didnt know The reflections did not fade\nand he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his\nsenses He couldnt stay here he had to find his way back to bed He\ntore his eyes away from his mothers face whispered Ill come back\nand hurried from the room\n\nYou could have woken me up said Ron crossly\n\nYou can come tonight Im going back I want to show you the mirror\n\nId like to see your mom and dad Ron said eagerly\n\nAnd I want to see all your family all the Weasleys youll be able to\nshow me your other brothers and everyone\n\nYou can see them any old time said Ron Just come round my house\nthis summer Anyway maybe it only shows dead people Shame about not\nfinding Flamel though Have some bacon or something why arent you\neating anything\n\nHarry couldnt eat He had seen his parents and would be seeing them\nagain tonight He had almost forgotten about Flamel It didnt seem very\nimportant anymore Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding\nWhat did it matter if Snape stole it really\n\nAre you all right said Ron You look odd\n\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror\nroom again With Ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much\nmore slowly the next night They tried retracing Harrys route from the\nlibrary wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour\n\nIm freezing said Ron Lets forget it and go back\n\nNo Harry hissed I know its here somewhere\n\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction\nbut saw no one else just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead\nwith cold Harry spotted the suit of armor\n\nIts here    just here    yes\n\nThey pushed the door open Harry dropped the cloak from around his\nshoulders and ran to the mirror\n\nThere they were His mother and father beamed at the sight of him\n\nSee Harry whispered\n\nI cant see anything\n\nLook Look at them all there are loads of them\n\nI can only see you\n\nLook in it properly go on stand where I am\n\nHarry stepped aside but with Ron in front of the mirror he couldnt\nsee his family anymore just Ron in his paisley pajamas\n\nRon though was staring transfixed at his image\n\nLook at me he said\n\nCan you see all your family standing around you\n\nNo    Im alone    but Im different    I look older    and Im head\nboy\n\nWhat\n\nI am    Im wearing the badge like Bill used to    and Im holding the\nhouse cup and the Quidditch cup    Im Quidditch captain too\n\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at\nHarry\n\nDo you think this mirror shows the future\n\nHow can it All my family are dead    let me have another look   \n\nYou had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more time\n\nYoure only holding the Quidditch cup whats interesting about that I\nwant to see my parents\n\nDont push me   \n\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion\nThey hadnt realized how loudly they had been talking\n\nQuick\n\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs Norris\ncame round the door Ron and Harry stood quite still both thinking the\nsame thing    did the cloak work on cats After what seemed an age she\nturned and left\n\nThis isnt safe    she might have gone for Filch I bet she heard us\nCome on\n\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room\n\nThe snow still hadnt melted the next morning\n\nWant to play chess Harry said Ron\n\nNo\n\nWhy dont we go down and visit Hagrid\n\nNo you go\n\nI know what youre thinking about Harry that mirror Dont go back\ntonight\n\nWhy not\n\nI dunno Ive just got a bad feeling about it    and anyway youve had\ntoo many close shaves already Filch Snape and Mrs Norris are\nwandering around So what if they cant see you What if they walk into\nyou What if you knock something over\n\nYou sound like Hermione\n\nIm serious Harry dont go\n\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in\nfront of the mirror and Ron wasnt going to stop him\n\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than before He was\nwalking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he\ndidnt meet anyone\n\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of\nhis grandfathers nodding happily Harry sank down to sit on the floor in\nfront of the mirror There was nothing to stop him from staying here all\nnight with his family Nothing at all\n\nExcept   \n\nSo    back again Harry\n\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice He looked behind\nhim Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus\nDumbledore Harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to\nget to the mirror he hadnt noticed him\n\n    I didnt see you sir\n\nStrange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said Dumbledore\nand Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling\n\nSo said Dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with\nHarry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of\nthe Mirror of Erised\n\nI didnt know it was called that Sir\n\nBut I expect youve realized by now what it does\n\nIt    well    it shows me my family   \n\nAnd it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy\n\nHow did you know   \n\nI dont need a cloak to become invisible said Dumbledore gently\nNow can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all\n\nHarry shook his head\n\nLet me explain The happiest man on earth would be able to use the\nMirror of Erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it\nand see himself exactly as he is Does that help\n\nHarry thought Then he said slowly It shows us what we want\nwhatever we want\n\nYes and no said Dumbledore quietly It shows us nothing more or less\nthan the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts You who have\nnever known your family see them standing around you Ronald Weasley\nwho has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing\nalone the best of all of them However this mirror will give us\nneither knowledge or truth Men have wasted away before it entranced by\nwhat they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is\nreal or even possible\n\nThe Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow Harry and I ask you\nnot to go looking for it again If you ever do run across it you will\nnow be prepared It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live\nremember that Now why dont you put that admirable cloak back on and\nget off to bed\n\nHarry stood up\n\nSir    Professor Dumbledore Can I ask you something\n\nObviously youve just done so Dumbledore smiled You may ask me one\nmore thing however\n\nWhat do you see when you look in the mirror\n\nI I see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks\n\nHarry stared\n\nOne can never have enough socks said Dumbledore Another Christmas\nhas come and gone and I didnt get a single pair People will insist on\ngiving me books\n\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore\nmight not have been quite truthful But then he thought as he shoved\nScabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal question\n\n\n",
    " THIRTEEN\n\nNICOLAS FLAMEL\n\nDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of\nErised again and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the\ninvisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk Harry\nwished he could forget what hed seen in the mirror as easily but he\ncouldnt He started having nightmares Over and over again he dreamed\nabout his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high\nvoice cackled with laughter\n\nYou see Dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said\nRon when Harry told him about these drearns\n\nHermione who came back the day before term started took a different\nview of things She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being\nout of bed roaming the school three nights in a row If Filch had\ncaught you and disappointment that he hadnt at least found out who\nNicolas Flamel was\n\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li  brary\nbook even though Harry was still sure hed read the name somewhere\nOnce term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten\nminutes during their breaks Harry had even less time than the other\ntwo because Quidditch practice had started again\n\nWood was working the team harder than ever Even the endless rain that\nhad replaced the snow couldnt dampen his spirits The Weasleys\ncomplained that Wood was becoming a fanatic but Harry was on Woods\nside If they won their next match against Hufflepuff they would\novertake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven\nyears Quite apart from wanting to win Harry found that he had fewer\nnightmares when he was tired out after training\n\nThen during one particularly wet and muddy practice session Wood gave\nthe team a bit of bad news Hed just gotten very angry with the\nWeasleys who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off\ntheir brooms\n\nWill you stop messing around he yelled Thats exactly the sort of\nthing thatll lose us the match Snapes refereeing this time and hell\nbe looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor\n\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words\n\nSnapes refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud Whens\nhe ever refereed a Quidditch match Hes not going to be fair if we\nmight overtake Slytherin\n\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain too\n\nIts not my fault said Wood Weve just got to make sure we play a\nclean game so Snape hasnt got an excuse to pick on us\n\nWhich was all very well thought Harry but he had another reason for\nnot wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch\n\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the\nend of practice but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common\nroom where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess Chess was the only\nthing Hermione ever lost at something Harry and Ron thought was very\ngood for her\n\nDont talk to me for a moment said Ron when Harry sat down next to\nhim I need to concen    He caught sight of Harrys face Whats the\nmatter with you You look terrible\n\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear Harry told the other\ntwo about Snapes sudden sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee\n\nDont play said Hermione at once\n\nSay youre ill said Ron\n\nPretend to break your leg Hermione suggested\n\nReally break your leg said Ron\n\nI cant said Harry There isnt a reserve Seeker If I back out\nGryffindor cant play at all\n\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room How he had managed\nto climb through the portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs\nhad been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the\nLeg Locker Curse He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to\nGryffindor tower\n\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione who leapt up and performed\nthe countercurse Nevilles legs sprang apart and he got to his feet\ntrembling What happened Hermione asked him leading him over to sit\nwith Harry and Ron\n\nMalfoy said Neville shakily I met him outside the library He said\nhed been looking for someone to practice that on\n\nGo to Professor McGonagall Hermione urged Neville Report him\n\nNeville shook his head\n\nI dont want more trouble he mumbled\n\nYouve got to stand up to him Neville said Ron Hes used to\nwalking all over people but thats no reason to lie down in front of\nhim and make it easier\n\nTheres no need to tell me Im not brave enough to be in Gryffindor\nMalfoys already done that Neville choked out\n\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog\nthe very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas He\ngave it to Neville who looked as though he might cry\n\nYoure worth twelve of Malfoy Harry said The Sorting Hat chose you\nfor Gryffindor didnt it And wheres Malfoy In stinking Slytherin\n\nNevilles lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog\n\nThanks Harry I think Ill go to bed Dyou want the card you\ncollect them dont you\n\nAs Neville walked away Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card\n\nDumbledore again he said He was the first one I ever \n\nHe gasped He stared at the back of the card Then he looked up at Ron\nand Hermione\n\nIve found him he whispered Ive found Flamel I told you Id read\nthe name somewhere before I read it on the train coming here    listen\nto this Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark\nwizard Grindelwald in 1945 for the discovery of the twelve uses of\ndragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas\nFlamel\n\nHermione jumped to her feet She hadnt looked so excited since theyd\ngotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework\n\nStay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\ndormitories Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks\nbefore she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms\n\nI never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly I got this\nout of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading\n\nLight said Ron but Hermione told him to be quiet until shed looked\nsomething up and started flicking frantically through the pages\nmuttering to herself\n\nAt last she found what she was looking for\n\nI knew it I knew it\n\nAre we allowed to speak yet said Ron grumpily Hermione ignored him\n\nNicolas Flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker\nof the Sorcerers Stone\n\nThis didnt have quite the effect shed expected\n\nThe what said Harry and Ron\n\nOh honestly dont you two read Look    read that there\n\nShe pushed the book toward them and Harry and Ron read The ancient\nstudy of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerers Stone a\nlegendary substance with astonishing powers The stone will transform\nany metal into pure gold It also produces the Elixir of Life which\nwill make the drinker immortal\n\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerers Stone over the centuries\nbut the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr Nicolas Flamel\nthe noted alchemist and opera lover Mr Flamel who celebrated his six\nhundred and sixty fifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in Devon\nwith his wife Perenelle six hundred and fifty eight\n\nSee said Hermione when Harry and Ron had finished The dog must be\nguarding Flamels Sorcerers Stone I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it\nsafe for him because theyre friends and he knew someone was after it\nthats why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts\n\nA stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said Harry No\nwonder Snapes after it Anyone would want it\n\nAnd no wonder we couldnt find Flamel in that Study of Recent\nDevelopments in Wizardry said Ron Hes not exactly recent if hes\nsix hundred and sixty five is he\n\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts while copying down\ndifferent ways of treating werewolf bites Harry and Ron were still\ndiscussing what theyd do with a Sorcerers Stone if they had one It\nwasnt until Ron said hed buy his own Quidditch team that Harry\nremembered about Snape and the coming match\n\nIm going to play he told Ron and Hermione If I dont all the\nSlytherins will think Im just too scared to face Snape Ill show\nthem itll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win\n\nJust as long as were not wiping you off the field said Hermione\n\nAs the match drew nearer however Harry became more and more nervous\nwhatever he told Ron and Hermione The rest of the team wasnt too calm\neither The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was\nwonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed\nto with such a biased referee\n\nHarry didnt know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to\nkeep running into Snape wherever he went At times he even wondered\nwhether Snape was following him trying to catch him on his own Potions\nlessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture Snape was so\nhorrible to Harry Could Snape possibly know theyd found out about the\nSorcerers Stone Harry didnt see how he could    yet he sometimes had\nthe horrible feeling that Snape could read minds\n\nHarry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the\nnext afternoon that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether theyd ever\nsee him alive again This wasnt what youd call comforting Harry\nhardly heard a word of Woods pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch\nrobes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand\n\nRon and Hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stands next to\nNeville who couldnt understand why they looked so grim and worried or\nwhy they had both brought their wands to the match Little did Harry\nknow that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg Locker\nCurse Theyd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville and were\nready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry\n\nNow dont forget its Locomotor Mortis Hermione muttered as Ron\nslipped his wand up his sleeve\n\nI know Ron snapped Dont nag\n\nBack in the locker room Wood had taken Harry aside\n\nDont want to pressure you Potter but if we ever need an early\ncapture of the Snitch its now Finish the game before Snape can favor\nHufflepuff too much\n\nThe whole schools out there said Fred Weasley peering out of the\ndoor Even    blimey    Dumbledores come to watch\n\nHarrys heart did a somersault\n\nDumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure Fred was right\nThere was no mistaking that silver beard\n\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe There was\nsimply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was\nwatching\n\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched\nonto the field something that Ron noticed too\n\nIve never seen Snape look so mean he told Hermione Look  theyre\noff Ouch\n\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head It was Malfoy\n\nOh sorry Weasley didnt see you there\n\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle\n\nWonder how long Potters going to stay on his broom this time Anyone\nwant a bet What about you Weasley\n\nRon didnt answer Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because\nGeorge Weasley had hit a Bludger at him Hermione who had all her\nfingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at Harry who was\ncircling the game like a hawk looking for the Snitch\n\nYou know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team said\nMalfoy loudly a few minutes later as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another\npenalty for no reason at all Its people they feel sorry for See\ntheres Potter whos got no parents then theres the Weasleys whove\ngot no money    you should be on the team Longbottom youve got no\nbrains\n\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy\n\nIm worth twelve of you Malfoy he stammered\n\nMalfoy Crabbe and Goyle howled with laughter but Ron still not\ndaring to take his eyes from the game said You tell him Neville\n\nLongbottom if brains were gold youd be poorer than Weasley and\nthats saying something\n\nRons nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety\nabout Harry\n\nIm warning you Malfoy    one more word\n\nRon said Hermione suddenly Harry   \n\nWhat Where\n\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and\ncheers from the crowd Hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her\nmouth as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet\n\nYoure in luck Weasley Potters obviously spotted some money on the\nground said Malfoy\n\nRon snapped Before Malfoy knew what was happening Ron was on top of\nhim wrestling him to the ground Neville hesitated then clambered over\nthe back of his seat to help\n\nCome on Harry Hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as\nHarry sped straight at Snape    she didnt even notice Malfoy and Ron\nrolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the\nwhirl of fists that was Neville Crabbe and Goyle\n\nUp in the air Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see\nsomething scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches    the next\nsecond Harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the\nSnitch clasped in his hand\n\nThe stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember\nthe Snitch being caught so quickly\n\nRon Ron Where are you The games over Harrys won Weve won\nGryffindor is in the lead shrieked Hermione dancing up and down on\nher seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front\n\nHarry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground He couldnt believe\nit Hed done it    the game was over it had barely lasted five\nminutes As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw Snape land\nnearby white faced and tight lipped    then Harry felt a hand on his\nshoulder and looked up into Dumbledores smiling face\n\nWell done said Dumbledore quietly so that only Harry could hear\nNice to see you havent been brooding about that mirror been keeping\nbusy excellent\n\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground\n\nHarry left the locker room alone some time later to take his Nimbus Two\nThousand back to the broomshed He couldnt ever remember feeling\nhappier Hed really done something to be proud of now    no one could\nsay he was just a famous name any more The evening air had never\nsmelled so sweet He walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour\nin his head which was a happy blur Gryffindors running to lift him\nonto their shoulders Ron and Hermione in the distance jumping up and\ndown Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed\n\nHarry had reached the shed He leaned against the wooden door and looked\nup at Hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sun\nGryffindor in the lead Hed done it hed shown Snape\n\nAnd speaking of Snape\n\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle Clearly\nnot wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the\nforbidden forest Harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched He\nrecognized the figures prowling walk Snape sneaking into the forest\nwhile everyone else was at dinner    what was going on\n\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off Gliding\nsilently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run He\nfollowed\n\nThe trees were so thick he couldnt see where Snape had gone He flew in\ncircles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he\nheard voices He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering\nbeech tree\n\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his\nbroomstick trying to see through the leaves Below in a shadowy\nclearing stood Snape but he wasnt alone Quirrell was there too\nHarry couldnt make out the look on his face but he was stuttering\nworse than ever Harry strained to catch what they were saying\n\n d dont know why you wanted t t to meet here of all p places\nSeverus\n\nOh I thought wed keep this private said Snape his voice icy\nStudents arent supposed to know about the Sorcerers Stone after\nall\n\nHarry leaned forward Quirrell was mumbling something Snape interrupted\nhim\n\nHave you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrids yet\n\nB b but Severus I   \n\nYou dont want me as your enemy Quirrell said Snape taking a step\ntoward him\n\nI I dont know what you\n\nYou know perfectly well what I mean\n\nAn owl hooted loudly and Harry nearly fell out of the tree He steadied\nhimself in time to hear Snape say    your little bit of hocus pocus\nIm waiting\n\nB but I d d dont   \n\nVery well Snape cut in Well have another little chat soon when\nyouve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties\nlie\n\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing It was\nalmost dark now but Harry could see Quirrell standing quite still as\nthough he was petrified\n\nHarry where have you been Hermione squeaked\n\nWe won You won We won shouted Ron thumping Harry on the back And\nI gave Malfoy a black eye and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle\nsingle handed Hes still out cold but Madam Pomftey says hell be all\nright   talk about showing Slytherin Everyones waiting for you in the\ncommon room were having a party Fred and George stole some cakes and\nstuff from the kitchens\n\nNever mind that now said Harry breathlessly Lets find an empty\nroom you wait til you hear this\n\nHe made sure Peeves wasnt inside before shutting the door behind them\nthen he told them what hed seen and heard\n\nSo we were right it is the Sorcerers Stone and Snapes trying to\nforce Quirrell to help him get it He asked if he knew how to get past\nFluffy   and he said something about Quirrells hocus pocuss   I reckon\nthere are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy loads of\nenchantments probably and Quirrell would have done some anti Dark Arts\nspell that Snape needs to break through   \n\nSo you mean the Stones only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to\nSnape said Hermione in alarm\n\nItll be gone by next Tuesday said Ron\n\n\n",
    " FOURTEEN\n\nNORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\n\nQuirrell however must have been braver than theyd thought In the\nweeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it\ndidnt look as though hed cracked yet\n\nEvery time they passed the third floor corridor Harry Ron and\nHermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was\nstill growling inside Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper\nwhich surely meant that the Stone was still safe Whenever Harry passed\nQuirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and Ron\nhad started telling people off for laughing at Quirrells stutter\n\nHermione however had more on her mind than the Sorcerers Stone She\nhad started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes\nHarry and Ron wouldnt have minded but she kept nagging them to do the\nsame\n\nHermione the exams are ages away\n\nTen weeks Hermione snapped Thats not ages thats like a second to\nNicolas Flamel\n\nBut were not six hundred years old Ron reminded her Anyway what\nare you studying for you already know it A\n\nWhat am I studying for Are you crazy You realize we need to pass\nthese exams to get into the second year Theyre very important I\nshould have started studying a month ago I dont know whats gotten\ninto me\n\nUnfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines\nas Hermione They piled so much homework on them that the Easter\nholidays werent nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones It was hard\nto relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragons\nblood or practicing wand movements Moaning and yawning Harry and Ron\nspent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get\nthrough all their extra work\n\nIll never remember this Ron burst out one afternoon throwing down\nhis quill and looking longingly out of the library window It was the\nfirst really fine day theyd had in months The sky was a clear\nforget me not blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming\n\nHarry who was looking up Dittany in One Thousand Magical Herbs and\nFungi didnt look up until he heard Ron say Hagrid What are you\ndoing in the library\n\nHagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back He looked\nvery out of place in his moleskin overcoat\n\nJus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their interest at\nonce An whatre you lot up ter He looked suddenly suspicious Yer\nnot still lookin fer Nicolas Flamel are yeh Oh we found out who he\nis ages ago said Ron impressively And we know what that dogs\nguarding its a Sorcerers St   \n\nShhhh Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening\nDon go shoutin about it whats the matter with yeh\n\nThere are a few things we wanted to ask you as a matter of fact said\nHarry about whats guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy   \n\nSHHHH said Hagrid again Listen   come an see me later Im not\npromisin Ill tell yeh anythin mind but don go rabbitin about it\nin here students aren spposed ter know Theyll think Ive told yeh\n  \n\nSee you later then said Harry\n\nHagrid shuffled off\n\nWhat was he hiding behind his back said Hermione thoughtfully\n\nDo you think it had anything to do with the Stone\n\nIm going to see what section he was in said Ron whod had enough of\nworking He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms\nand slammed them down on the table\n\nDragons he whispered Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons\nLook at these Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland From Egg to\nInferno A Dragon Keepers Guide\n\nHagrids always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time I ever\nmet him  said Harry\n\nBut its against our laws said Ron Dragon breeding was outlawed by\nthe Warlocks Convention of 1709 everyone knows that Its hard to stop\nMuggles from noticing us if were keeping dragons in the back garden  \nanyway you cant tame dragons its dangerous You should see the burns\nCharlies got off wild ones in Romania\n\nBut there arent wild dragons in Britain said Harry\n\nOf course there are said Ron Common Welsh Green and Hebridean\nBlacks The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up I can tell you\nOur kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles whove spotted them to\nmake them forget\n\nSo what on earths Hagrid up to said Hermione\n\nWhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeepers hut an hour later\nthey were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed Hagrid\ncalled Who is it before he let them in and then shut the door\nquickly behind them\n\nIt was stifling hot inside Even though it was such a warm day there\nwas a blazing fire in the grate Hagrid made them tea and offered them\nstoat sandwiches which they refused\n\nSo    yeh wanted to ask me somethin\n\nYes said Harry There was no point beating around the bush We were\nwondering if you could tell us whats guarding the Sorcerers Stone\napart from Fluffy\n\nHagrid frowned at him\n\n0 course I cant he said Number one I don know meself Number two\nyeh know too much already so I wouldn tell yeh if I could That\nStones here fer a good reason It Was almost stolen outta Gringotts   I\nsppose yehve worked that out an all Beats me how yeh even know abou\nFluffy\n\nOh come on Hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know\nyou know everything that goes on round here said Hermione in a warm\nflattering voice Hagrids beard twitched and they could tell he was\nsmiling We only wondered who had done the guarding really Hermione\nwent on We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him\napart from you\n\nHagrids chest swelled at these last words Harry and Ron beamed at\nHermione\n\nWell I don spose it could hurt ter tell yeh that lets see he\nborrowed Fluffy from me then some o the teachers did enchantments\nProfessor Sprout    Professor Flitwick    Professor McGonagall    he\nticked them off on his fingers Professor Quirrell    an Dumbledore\nhimself did somethin o course Hang on Ive forgotten someone Oh\nyeah Professor Snape\n\nSnape\n\nYeah    yer not still on abou that are yeh Look Snape helped\nprotect the Stone hes not about ter steal it\n\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was If Snape\nhad been in on protecting the Stone it must have been easy to find out\nhow the other teachers had guarded it He probably knew everything   \nexcept it seemed Quirrells spell and how to get past Fluffy\n\nYoure the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy arent you\nHagrid said Harry anxiously And you wouldnt tell anyone would you\nNot even one of the teachers\n\nNot a soul knows except me an Dumbledore said Hagrid proudly\n\nWell thats something Harry muttered to the others Hagrid can we\nhave a window open Im boiling\n\nCant Harry sorry said Hagrid Harry noticed him glance at the\nfire Harry looked at it too\n\nHagrid    whats that\n\nBut he already knew what it was In the very heart of the fire\nunderneath the kettle was a huge black egg\n\nAh said Hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard Thats er\n\nWhere did you get it Hagrid said Ron crouching over the fire to get\na closer look at the egg It mustve cost you a fortune\n\nWon it said Hagrid Las night I was down in the village havin a\nfew drinks an got into a game o cards with a stranger Think he was\nquite glad ter get rid of it ter be honest\n\nBut what are you going to do with it when its hatched said Hermione\n\nWell Ive bin doin some readin  said Hagrid pulling a large book\nfrom under his pillow Got this outta the library    Dragon Breeding\nfor Pleasure and Profit    its a bit outta date o course but its\nall in here Keep the egg in the fire cause their mothers breathe on I\nem see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket o brandy mixed with\nchicken blood every half hour An see here    how ter recognize\ndiffrent eggs    what I got theres a Norwegian Ridgeback Theyre\nrare them\n\nHe looked very pleased with himself but Hermione didnt\n\nHagrid you live in a wooden house she said\n\nBut Hagrid wasnt listening He was humming merrily as he stoked the\nfire\n\nSo now they had something else to worry about what might happen to\nHagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut\nWonder what its like to have a peaceful life Ron sighed as evening\nafter evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were\ngetting Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and\nRon too It was driving them nuts\n\nThen one breakfast time Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid\nHe had written only two words Its hatching\n\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut Hermione\nwouldnt hear of it\n\nHermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon\nhatching\n\nWeve got lessons well get into trouble and thats nothing to what\nHagrids going to be in when someone finds out what hes doing   \n\nShut up Harry whispered\n\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen How\nmuch had he heard Harry didnt like the look on Malfoys face at all\n\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end\nHermione agreed to run down to Hagrids with the other two during\nmorning break When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their\nlesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried\nthrough the grounds to the edge of the forest Hagrid greeted them\nlooking flushed and excited\n\nIts nearly out He ushered them inside\n\nThe egg was lying on the table There were deep cracks in it Something\nwas moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it\n\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated\nbreath\n\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open The baby\ndragon flopped onto the table It wasnt exactly pretty Harry thought\nit looked like a crumpled black umbrella Its spiny wings were huge\ncompared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils\nthe stubs of horns and bulging orange eyes\n\nIt sneezed A couple of sparks flew out of its snout\n\nIsnt he beautiful Hagrid murmured He reached out a hand to stroke\nthe dragons head It snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangs\n\nBless him look he knows his mommy said Hagrid\n\nHagrid said Hermione how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow\nexactly\n\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face\n   he leapt to his feet and ran to the window\n\nWhats the matter\n\nSomeone was lookin through the gap in the curtains    its a kid   \nhes runnin back up ter the school\n\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out Even at a distance there was no\nmistaking him\n\nMalfoy had seen the dragon\n\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoys face during the next week\nmade Harry Ron and Hermione very nervous They spent most of their\nfree time in Hagrids darkened hut trying to reason with him\n\nJust let him go Harry urged Set him free\n\nI cant said Hagrid Hes too little Hed die\n\nThey looked at the dragon It had grown three times in length in just a\nweek Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils Hagrid hadnt been doing\nhis gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy There\nwere empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor\n\nIve decided to call him Norbert said Hagrid looking at the dragon\nwith misty eyes He really knows me now watch Norbert Norbert\nWheres Mommy\n\nHes lost his marbles Ron muttered in Harrys ear\n\nHagrid said Harry loudly give it two weeks and Norberts going to\nbe as long as your house Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment\n\nHagrid bit his lip\n\nI    I know I cant keep him forever but I cant jus dump him I\ncant\n\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron Charlie he said\n\nYoure losing it too said Ron Im Ron remember\n\nNo    Charlie    your brother Charlie In Romania Studying dragons\nWe could send Norbert to him Charlie can take care of him and then put\nhim back in the wild\n\nBrilliant said Ron How about it Hagrid\n\nAnd in the end Hagrid agreed that they could send  an owl to Charlie to\nask him\n\nThe following week dragged by Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry\nsitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to\nbed The clock on the wall had just\n\nchimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open Ron appeared out of\nnowhere as he pulled off Harrys invisibility cloak He had been down at\nHagrids hut helping him feed Norbert who was now eating dead rats by\nthe crate\n\nIt bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a\nbloody handkerchief Im not going to be able to hold a quill for a\nweek I tell you that dragons the most horrible animal Ive ever met\nbut the way Hagrid goes on about it youd think it was a fluffy little\nbunny rabbit When it bit me he told me off for frightening it And when\nI left he was singing it a lullaby\n\nThere was a tap on the dark window\n\nIts Hedwig said Harry hurrying to let her in Shell have\nCharlies answer\n\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note\n\nDear Ron\n\nHow are you Thanks for the letter    Id be glad to take the Norwegian\nRidgeback but it wont be easy getting him here I think the best thing\nwill be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to\nvisit me next week Trouble is they mustnt be seen carrying an illegal\ndragon\n\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on\nSaturday They can meet you there and take him away while its still\ndark\n\nSend me an answer as soon as possible\n\nLove\n\nCharlie\n\nThey looked at one another\n\nWeve got the invisibility cloak said Harry It shouldnt be too\ndifficult    I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and\nNorbert\n\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two\nagreed with him Anything to get rid of Norbert    and Malfoy\n\nThere was a hitch By the next morning Rons bitten hand had swollen to\ntwice its usual size He didnt know whether it was safe to go to Madam\nPomfrey    would she recognize a dragon bite By the afternoon though\nhe had no choice The cut had turned a nasty shade of green It looked\nas if Norberts fangs were poisonous\n\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day\nto find Ron in a terrible state in bed\n\nIts not just my hand he whispered although that feels like its\nabout to fall off Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of\nmy books so he could come and have a good laugh at me He kept\nthreatening to tell her what really bit me    Ive told her it was a\ndog but I dont think she believes me  I shouldnt have hit him at the\nQuidditch match thats why hes doing this\n\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down\n\nItll all be over at midnight on Saturday said Hermione but this\ndidnt soothe Ron at all On the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke\ninto a sweat\n\nMidnight on Saturday he said in a hoarse voice Oh no oh no    Ive\njust remembered    Charlies letter was in that book Malfoy took hes\ngoing to know were getting rid of Norbert\n\nHarry and Hermione didnt get a chance to answer Madam Pomfrey came\nover at that moment and made them leave saying Ron needed sleep\n\nIts too late to change the plan now Harry told Hermione We havent\ngot time to send Charlie another owl and this could be our only chance\nto get rid of Norbert Well have to risk it And we have got the\ninvisibility cloak Malfoy doesnt know about that\n\nThey found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail\nwhen they went to tell Hagrid who opened a window to talk to them\n\nI wont let you in he puffed Norberts at a tricky stage    nothin\nI cant handle\n\nWhen they told him about Charlies letter his eyes filled with tears\nalthough that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the\nleg\n\nAargh Its all right he only got my boot    jus playin    hes only\na baby after all\n\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle Harry\nand Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldnt come\nquickly enough\n\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say\ngood bye to Norbert if they hadnt been so worried about what they had\nto do It was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late\narriving at Hagrids hut because theyd had to wait for Peeves to get\nout of their way in the entrance hall where hed been playing tennis\nagainst the wall Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate\n\nHes got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey said Hagrid in\na muffled voice An Ive packed his teddy bear in case he gets\nlonely\n\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as\nthough the teddy was having his head torn off\n\nBye bye Norbert Hagrid sobbed as Harry and Hermione covered the\ncrate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves\nMommy will never forget you\n\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never\nknew Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble\nstaircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors UP another\nstaircase then another    even one of Harrys shortcuts didnt make the\nwork much easier\n\nNearly there Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the\ntallest tower\n\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate\nForgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the\nshadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each\nother ten feet away A lamp flared\n\nProfessor McGonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had Malfoy by\nthe ear\n\nDetention she shouted And twenty points from Slytherin Wandering\naround in the middle of the night how dare you   \n\nYou dont understand Professor Harry Potters coming    hes got a\ndragon\n\nWhat utter rubbish How dare you tell such lies Come on    I shall see\nProfessor Snape about you Malfoy\n\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest\nthing in the world after that Not until theyd stepped out into the\ncold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe\nproperly again Hermione did a sort of jig\n\nMalfoys got detention I could sing\n\nDont Harry advised her\n\nChuckling about Malfoy they waited Norbert thrashing about in his\ncrate About ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out\nof the darkness\n\nCharlies friends were a cheery lot They showed Harry and Hermione the\nharness theyd rigged up so they could suspend Norbert between them\nThey all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and\nHermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much\n\nAt last Norbert was going going gone\n\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as\ntheir hands now that Norbert was off them No more dragon    Malfoy in\ndetention    what could spoil their happiness\n\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs As they\nstepped into the corridor Filchs face loomed suddenly out of the\ndarkness\n\nWell well well he whispered we are in trouble\n\nTheyd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower\n\n\n",
    " FIFTEEN\n\nTHE FORIBIDDEN FOREST\n\nThings couldnt have been worse\n\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagalls study on the first floor\nwhere they sat and waited without saying a word to each other Hermione\nwas trembling Excuses alibis and wild cover  up stories chased each\nother around Harrys brain each more feeble than the last He couldnt\nsee how they were going to get out of trouble this time They were\ncornered How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak\nThere was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for\ntheir being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of\nnight let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was\nout of bounds except for classes Add Norbert and the invisibility\ncloak and they might as well be packing their bags already\n\nHad Harry thought that things couldnt have been worse He was wrong\nWhen Professor McGonagall appeared she was leading Neville\n\nHarry Neville burst Out the moment he saw the other two I was\ntrying to find you to warn you I heard Malfoy saying he was going to\ncatch you he said you had a drag   \n\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up but Professor\nMcGonagall had seen She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert\nas she towered over the three of them\n\nI would never have believed it of any of you Mr Filch says you were\nup in the astronomy tower Its one oclock in the morning Explain\nyourselves\n\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teachers\nquestion She was staring at her slippers as still as a statue\n\nI think Ive got a good idea of whats been going on said Professor\nMcGonagall It doesnt take a genius to work it out You fed Draco\nMalfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon trying to get him out of\nbed and into trouble Ive already caught him I suppose you think its\nfunny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it too\n\nHarry caught Nevilles eye and tried to tell him without words that this\nwasnt true because Neville was looking stunned and hurt Poor\nblundering Neville    Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and\nfind them in the dark to warn them\n\nIm disgusted said Professor McGonagall Four students out of bed in\none night Ive never heard of such a thing before You Miss Granger I\nthought you had more sense As for you Mr Potter I thought Gryffindor\nmeant more to you than this All three of you will receive detentions   \nyes you too Mr Longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around\nschool at night especially these days its very dangerous    and fifty\npoints will be taken from Gryffindor\n\nFifty Harry gasped    they would lose the lead the lead hed won in\nthe last Quidditch match\n\nFifty points each said Professor McGonagall breathing heavily\nthrough her long pointed nose\n\nProfessor    please\n\nYou cant   \n\nDont tell me what I can and cant do Potter Now get back to bed all\nof you Ive never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students\n\nA hundred and fifty points lost That put Gryffindor in last place In\none night theyd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house\ncup Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach How\ncould they ever make up for this\n\nHarry didnt sleep all night He could hear Neville sobbing into his\npillow for what seemed like hours Harry couldnt think of anything to\nsay to comfort him He knew Neville like himself was dreading the\ndawn What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what\ntheyd done\n\nAt first Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the\nhouse points the next day thought thered been a mistake How could they\nsuddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday And then\nthe story started to spread Harry Potter the famous Harry Potter\ntheir hero of two Quidditch matches had lo st them all those points\nhim and a couple of other stupid first years\n\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the school\nHarry was suddenly the most hated Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs\nturned on him because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose\nthe house cup Everywhere Harry went people pointed and didnt trouble\nto lower their voices as they insulted him Slytherins on the other\nhand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering Thanks\nPotter we owe you one\n\nOnly Ron stood by him\n\nTheyll all forget this in a few weeks Fred and George have lost loads\nof points in all the time theyve been here and people still like\nthem\n\nTheyve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have\nthey said Harry miserably\n\nWell    no Ron admitted\n\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage but Harry swore to himself not\nto meddle in things that werent his business from now on Hed had it\nwith sneaking around and spying He felt so ashamed of himself that he\nwent to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team\n\nResign Wood thundered What goodll that do How are we going to get\nany points back if we cant win at Quidditch\n\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun The rest of the team wouldnt speak\nto Harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they\ncalled him the Seeker\n\nHermione and Neville were suffering too They didnt have as bad a time\nas Harry because they werent as well known but nobody would speak to\nthem either Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in\nclass keeping her head down and working in silence\n\nHarry was almost glad that the exams werent far away All the studying\nhe had to do kept his mind off his misery He Ron and Hermione kept to\nthemselves working late into the night trying to remember the\ningredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart\nmemorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions\n\nThen about a week before the exams were due to start Harrys new\nresolution not to interfere in anything that didnt concern him was put\nto an unexpected test Walking back from the library on his own one\nafternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead As he\ndrew closer he heard Quirrells voice\n\nNo    no    not again please   \n\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him Harry moved closer\n\nAll right    all right    he heard Quirrell sob\n\nNext second Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening\nhis turban He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry He\nstrode out of sight Harry didnt think Quirrell had even noticed him\nHe waited until Quirrells footsteps had disappeared then peered into\nthe classroom It was empty but a door stood ajar at the other end\nHarry was halfway toward it before he remembered what hed promised\nhimself about not meddling\n\nAll the same hed have gambled twelve Sorcerers Stones that Snape had\njust left the room and from what Harry had just heard Snape would be\nwalking with a new spring in his step    Quirrell seemed to have given\nin at last\n\nHarry went back to the library where Hermione was testing Ron on\nAstronomy Harry told them what hed heard\n\nSnapes done it then said Ron If Quirrells told him how to break\nhis Anti Dark Force spell   \n\nTheres still Fluffy though said Hermione\n\nMaybe Snapes found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid\nsaid Ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them I bet\ntheres a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant\nthree headed dog So what do we do Harry\n\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Rons eyes but Hermione\nanswered before Harry could\n\nGo to Dumbledore Thats what we should have done ages ago If we try\nanything ourselves well be thrown out for sure\n\nBut weve got no proof said Harry Quirrells too scared to back us\nup Snapes only got to say he doesnt know how the troll got in at\nHalloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor    who do you\nthink theyll believe him or us Its not exactly a secret we hate him\nDumbledorell think we made it up to get him sacked Filch wouldnt help\nus if his life depended on it hes too friendly with Snape and the\nmore students get thrown out the better hell think And dont forget\nwere not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy Thatll take a lot\nof explaining\n\nHermione looked convinced but Ron didnt\n\nIf we just do a bit of poking around   \n\nNo said Harry flatly weve done enough poking around\n\nHe pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of\nits moons\n\nThe following morning notes were delivered to Harry Hermione and\nNeville at the breakfast table They were all the same\n\nYour detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight Meet Mr Filch\nin the entrance hall\n\nProfessor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do\nin the furor over the points theyd lost He half expected Hermione to\ncomplain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didnt\nsay a word Like Harry she felt they deserved what theyd got\n\nAt eleven oclock that night they said good bye to Ron in the common\nroom and went down to the entrance hall with Neville Filch was already\nthere    and so was Malfoy Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had\ngotten a detention too\n\nFollow me said Filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside\n\nI bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule again wont you\neh he said leering at them Oh yes hard work and pain are the\nbest teachers if you ask me Its just a pity they let the old\npunishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a\nfew days Ive got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in\ncase theyre ever needed Right off we go and dont think of\nrunning off now itll be worse for you if you do\n\nThey marched off across the dark grounds Neville kept sniffing Harry\nwondered what their punishment was going to be It must be something\nreally horrible or Filch wouldnt be sounding so delighted\n\nThe moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them\ninto darkness Ahead Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrids\nhut Then they heard a distant shout\n\nIs that you Filch Hurry up I want ter get started\n\nHarrys heart rose if they were going to be working with Hagrid it\nwouldnt be so bad His relief must have showed in his  face because\nFilch said I suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that\noaf Well think again boy    its into the forest youre going and Im\nmuch mistaken if youll all come out in one piece\n\nAt this Neville let out a little moan and Malfoy stopped dead in his\ntracks\n\nThe forest he repeated and he didnt sound quite as cool as usual\nWe cant go in there at night    theres all sorts of things in there\n   werewolves I heard\n\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harrys robe and made a choking noise\n\nThats your problem isnt it said Filch his voice cracking with\nglee Shouldve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble\nshouldnt you\n\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark Fang at his heel He\nwas carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his\nshoulder\n\nAbou time he said I bin waitin fer half an hour already All\nright Harry Hermione\n\nI shouldnt be too friendly to them Hagrid said Filch coldly\ntheyre here to be punished after all\n\nThats why yer late is it said Hagrid frowning at Filch Bin\nlecturin them eh Snot your place ter do that Yehve done yer bit\nIll take over from here\n\nIll be back at dawn said Filch for whats left of them he added\nnastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp\nbobbing away in the darkness\n\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid\n\nIm not going in that forest he said and Harry was pleased to hear\nthe note of panic in his voice\n\nYeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts said Hagrid fiercely\nYehve done wrong an now yehve got ter pay fer it\n\nBut this is servant stuff its not for students to do I thought wed\nbe copying lines or something if my father knew I was doing this hed\n\ntell yer thats how it is at Hogwarts Hagrid growled Copyin lines\nWhat goods that ter anyone Yehll do summat useful or Yehll get out\nIf yeh think yer fatherd rather you were expelled then get back off\nter the castle an pack Go on\n\nMalfoy didnt move He looked at Hagrid furiously but then dropped his\ngaze\n\nRight then said Hagrid now listen carefully cause its dangerous\nwhat were gonna do tonight an I don want no one takin risks Follow\nme over here a moment\n\nHe led them to the very edge of the forest Holding his lamp up high he\npointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the\nthick black trees A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into\nthe forest\n\nLook there said Hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground\nSilvery stuff Thats unicorn blood Theres a unicorn in there bin hurt\nbadly by summat This is the second time in a week I found one dead\nlast Wednesday Were gonna try an find the poor thing We might have\nter put it out of its misery\n\nAnd what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first said Malfoy\nunable to keep the fear out of his voice\n\nTheres nothin that lives in the forest thatll hurt yeh if yer with\nme or Fang said Hagrid An keep ter the path Right now were\ngonna split inter two parties an follow the trail in diffrent\ndirections Theres blood all over the place it mustve bin staggerin\naround since last night at least\n\nI want Fang said Malfoy quickly looking at Fangs long teeth\n\nAll right but I warn yeh hes a coward said Hagrid  So me Harry\nan Hermionell go one way an Draco Neville an Fangll go the other\nNow if any of us finds the unicorn well send up green sparks right\nGet yer wands out an practice now    thats it    an if anyone gets in\ntrouble send up red sparks an well all come an find yeh    so be\ncareful    lets go\n\nThe forest was black and silent A little way into it they reached a\nfork in the earth path and Harry Hermione and Hagrid took the left\npath while Malfoy Neville and Fang took the right\n\nThey walked in silence their eyes on the ground Every now and then a\nray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue\nblood on the fallen leaves\n\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried\n\nCould a werewolf be killing the unicorns Harry asked\n\nNot fast enough said Hagrid Its not easy ter catch a unicorn\ntheyre powerful magic creatures I never knew one ter be hurt before\n\nThey walked past a mossy tree stump Harry could hear running water\nthere must be a stream somewhere close by There were still spots of\nunicorn blood here and there along the winding path\n\nYou all right Hermione Hagrid whispered Don worry it cantve\ngone far if its this badly hurt an then well be able ter    GET\nBEHIND THAT TREE\n\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a\ntowering oak He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow\nraising it ready to fire The three of them listened Something was\nslithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing\nalong the ground Hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few\nseconds the sound faded away\n\nI knew it  he murmured Theres summat in here that shouldn be\n\nA werewolf Harry suggested\n\nThat wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said Hagrid\ngrimly Right follow me but careful now\n\nThey walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest sound\nSuddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved\n\nWhos there Hagrid called Show yerself    Im armed\n\nAnd into the clearing came    was it a man or a horse To the waist a\nman with red hair and beard but below that was a horses gleaming\nchestnut body with a long reddish tail Harry and Hermiones jaws\ndropped\n\nOh its you Ronan said Hagrid in relief How are yeh\n\nHe walked forward and shook the centaurs hand\n\nGood evening to you Hagrid said Ronan He had a deep sorrowful\nvoice Were you going to shoot me\n\nCant be too careful Ronan said Hagrid patting his crossbow\nTheres summat bad loose in this forest This is Harry Potter an\nHermione Granger by the way Students up at the school An this is\nRonan you two Hes a centaur\n\nWed noticed said Hermione faintly\n\nGood evening said Ronan Students are you And do you learn much\nup at the school\n\nErm   \n\nA bit said Hermione timidly\n\nA bit Well thats something Ronan sighed He flung back his head\nand stared at the sky Mars is bright tonight\n\nYeah said Hagrid glancing up too Listen Im glad weve run inter\nyeh Ronan cause theres a unicorn bin hurt    you seen anythin\n\nRonan didnt answer immediately He stared unblinkingly upward then\nsighed again\n\nAlways the innocent are the first victims he said So it has been\nfor ages past so it is now\n\nYeah said Hagrid but have yeh seen anythin Ronan Anythin\nunusual\n\nMars is bright tonight Ronan repeated while Hagrid watched him\nimpatiently Unusually bright\n\nYeah but I was meanin anythin unusual a bit nearer home said\nHagrid So yeh havent noticed anythin strange\n\nYet again Ronan took a while to answer At last he said The forest\nhides many secrets\n\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again\nbut it was only a second centaur black haired and  bodied and\nwilder looking than Ronan\n\nHullo Bane said Hagrid All right\n\nGood evening Hagrid I hope you are well\n\nWell enough Look Ive jus bin askin Ronan you seen anythin odd in\nhere lately Theres a unicorn bin injured    would yeh know anythin\nabout it\n\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan He looked skyward Mars is\nbright tonight he said simply\n\nWeve heard said Hagrid grumpily Well if either of you do see\nanythin let me know wont yeh Well be off then\n\nHarry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their\nshoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view\n\nNever said Hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a\ncentaur Ruddy stargazers Not interested in anythin closern the\nmoon\n\nAre there many of them in here asked Hermione\n\nOh a fair few Keep themselves to themselves mostly but theyre\ngood enough about turnin up if ever I want a word Theyre deep mind\ncentaurs they know things jus don let on much\n\nDyou think that was a centaur we heard earlier said Harry\n\nDid that sound like hooves to you Nah if yeh ask me that was whats\nbin killin the unicorns    never heard anythin like it before\n\nThey walked on through the dense dark trees Harry kept looking\nnervously over his shoulder He had the nasty feeling they were being\nwatched He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them\nThey had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrids\narm\n\nHagrid Look Red sparks the others are in trouble\n\nYou two wait here Hagrid shouted Stay on the path Ill come back\nfor yeh\n\nThey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking\nat each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything but the\nrustling of leaves around them\n\nYou dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered Hermione\n\nI dont care if Malfoy has but if somethings got Neville its our\nfault hes here in the first place\n\nThe minutes dragged by Their ears seemed sharper than usual Harrys\nseemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twig\nWhat was going on Where were the others\n\nAt last a great crunching noise announced Hagrids return Malfoy\nNeville and Fang were with him Hagrid was fuming Malfoy it seemed\nhad sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke Neville had\npanicked and sent up the sparks\n\nWell be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were\nmakin Right were changin groups    Neville you stay with me an\nHermione Harry you go with Fang an this idiot Im sorry Hagrid\nadded in a whisper to Harry but hell have a harder time frightenin\nyou an weve gotta get this done\n\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang They\nwalked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until\nthe path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so\nthick Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker There were\nsplashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been\nthrashing around in pain close by Harry could see a clearing ahead\nthrough the tangled branches of an ancient oak\n\nLook    he murmured holding out his arm to stop Malfoy\n\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground They inched closer\n\nIt was the unicorn all right and it was dead Harry had never seen\nanything so beautiful and sad Its long slender legs were stuck out at\nodd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on\nthe dark leaves\n\nHarry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him\nfreeze where he stood A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered\nThen out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the\nground like some stalking beast Harry Malfoy and Fang stood\ntransfixed The cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head\nover the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood\n\nAAAAAAAAAARGH\n\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted    so did Fang The hooded\nfigure raised its head and looked right at Harry    unicorn blood was\ndribbling down its front It got to its feet and came swiftly toward\nHarry    he couldnt move for fear\n\nThen a pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it was as\nthough his scar were on fire Half blinded he staggered backward He\nheard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over\nHarry charging at the figure\n\nThe pain in Harrys head was so bad he fell to his knees It took a\nminute or two to pass When he looked up the figure had gone A centaur\nwas standing over him not Ronan or Bane this one looked younger he\nhad white blond hair and a palomino body\n\nAre you all right said the centaur pulling Harry to his feet\n\nYes    thank you    what was that\n\nThe centaur didnt answer He had astonishingly blue eyes like pale\nsapphires He looked carefully at Harry his eyes lingering on the scar\nthat stood out livid on Harrys forehead\n\nYou are the Potter boy he said You had better get back to Hagrid\nThe forest is not safe at this time    especially for you Can you ride\nIt will be quicker this way\n\nMy name is Firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front\nlegs so that Harry could clamber onto his back\n\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the\nclearing Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees their flanks\nheaving and sweaty\n\nFirenze Bane thundered What are you doing You have a human on your\nback Have you no shame Are you a common mule\n\nDo you realize who this is said Firenze This is the Potter boy The\nquicker he leaves this forest the better\n\nWhat have you been telling him growled Bane Remember Firenze we\nare sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens Have we not read\nwhat is to come in the movements of the planets\n\nRonan pawed the ground nervously Im sure Firenze thought he was\nacting for the best  he said in his gloomy voice\n\nBane kicked his back legs in anger\n\nFor the best What is that to do with us Centaurs are concerned with\nwhat has been foretold It is not our business to run around like\ndonkeys after stray humans in our forest\n\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that Harry had\nto grab his shoulders to stay on\n\nDo you not see that unicorn Firenze bellowed at Bane Do you not\nunderstand why it was killed Or have the planets not let you in on that\nsecret I set myself against what is lurking in this forest Bane yes\nwith humans alongside me if I must\n\nAnd Firenze whisked around with Harry clutching on as best he could\nthey plunged off into the trees leaving Ronan and Bane behind them\n\nHarry didnt have a clue what was going on\n\nWhys Bane so angry he asked What was that thing you saved me from\nanyway\n\nFirenze slowed to a walk warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of\nlow hanging branches but did not answer Harrys question They made\ntheir way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought\nFirenze didnt want to talk to him anymore They were passing through a\nparticularly dense patch of trees however when Firenze suddenly\nstopped\n\nHarry Potter do you know what unicorn blood is used  for\n\nNo said Harry startled by the odd question Weve only used the\nhorn and tail hair in Potions\n\nThat is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said\nFirenze Only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain\nwould commit such a crime The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive\neven if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price You have\nslain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have\nbut a half life a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your\nlips\n\nHarry stared at the back of Firenzes head which was dappled silver in\nthe moonlight\n\nBut whod be that desperate he wondered aloud If youre going to be\ncursed forever deaths better isnt it\n\nIt is Firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long\nenough to drink something else    something that will bring you back to\nfull strength and power    something that will mean you can never die\nMr Potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very\nmoment\n\nThe Sorcerers Stone Of course    the Elixir of Life But I dont\nunderstand who   \n\nCan you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power\nwho has clung to life awaiting their chance\n\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harrys\nheart Over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what\nHagrid had told him on the night they had met Some say he died\nCodswallop in my opinion Dunno if he had enough human left in him to\ndie\n\nDo you mean Harry croaked that was Vol \n\nHarry Harry are you all right\n\nHermione was running toward them down the path Hagrid puffing along\nbehind her\n\nIm fine said Harry hardly knowing what he was saying The\nunicorns dead Hagrid its in that clearing back there\n\nThis is where I leave you Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to\nexamine the unicorn You are safe now\n\nHarry slid off his back\n\nGood luck Harry Potter said Firenze The planets have been read\nwrongly before now even by centaurs I hope this is one of those\ntimes\n\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving Harry\nshivering behind him\n\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to\nreturn He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly\nshook him awake In a matter of seconds though he was wide eyed as\nHarry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest\n\nHarry couldnt sit down He paced up and down in front of the fire He\nwas still shaking\n\nSnape wants the stone for Voldemort and Voldemorts waiting in the\nforest and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get\nrich\n\nStop saying the name said Ron in a terrified whisper as if he\nthought Voldemort could hear them\n\nHarry wasnt listening\n\nFirenze saved me but he shouldnt have done so Bane was furious\nhe was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to\nhappen They must show that Voldemorts coming back Bane thinks\nFirenze should have let Voldemort kill me I suppose thats written\nin the stars as well\n\nWill you stop saying the name Ron hissed\n\nSo all Ive got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone Harry\nwent on feverishly then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me\noff Well I suppose Banell be happy\n\nHermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort\n\nHarry everyone says Dumbledores the only one You Know Who was ever\nafraid of With Dumbledore around You Know Who wont touch you Anyway\nwho says the centaurs are right It sounds like fortune telling to me\nand Professor McGonagall says thats a very imprecise branch of magic\n\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking They went to bed\nexhausted their throats sore But the nights surprises werent over\n\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak\nfolded neatly underneath them There was a note pinned to it\n\nJust in case\n\n\n",
    " SIXTEEN\n\nTHROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\n\nIn years to come Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to\nget through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting\nthrough the door at any moment Yet the days crept by and there could\nbe no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door\n\nIt was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did\ntheir written papers They had been given special new quills for the\nexams which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell\n\nThey had practical exams as well Professor Flitwick called them one by\none into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across\na desk Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox\n   points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if\nit had whiskers Snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks\nwhile they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion\n\nHarry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his\nforehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the\nforest Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because\nHarry couldnt sleep but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by\nhis old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there\nwas a hooded figure dripping blood in it\n\nMaybe it was because they hadnt seen what Harry had seen in the forest\nor because they didnt have scars burning on their foreheads but Ron\nand Hermione didnt seem as worried about the Stone as Harry The idea\nof Voldemort certainly scared them but he didnt keep visiting them in\ndreams and they were so busy with their studying they didnt have much\ntime to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to\n\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic One hour of answering\nquestions about batty old wizards whod invented selfstirring cauldrons\nand theyd be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam\nresults came out When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put\ndown their quills and roll up their parchment Harry couldnt help\ncheering with the rest\n\nThat was far easier than I thought it would be said Hermione as they\njoined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds I neednt have\nlearned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of\nElfric the Eager\n\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward but Ron\nsaid this made him feel ill so they wandered down to the lake and\nflopped under a tree The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the\ntentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows No\nmore studying Ron sighed happily stretching out on the grass You\ncould look more cheerful Harry weve got a week before we find out how\nbadly weve done theres no need to worry yet\n\nHarry was rubbing his forehead\n\nI wish I knew what this means he burst out angrily My scar keeps\nhurting    its happened before but never as often as this\n\nGo to Madam Pomfrey Hermione suggested\n\nIm not ill said Harry I think its a warning it means dangers\ncoming\n\nRon couldnt get worked up it was too hot\n\nHarry relax Hermiones right the Stones safe as long as\nDumbledores around Anyway weve never had any proof Snape found out\nhow to get past Fluffy He nearly had his leg ripped off once hes not\ngoing to try it again in a hurry And Neville will play Quidditch for\nEngland before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down\n\nHarry nodded but he couldnt shake off a lurking feeling that there was\nsomething hed forgotten to do something important When he tried to\nexplain this Hermione said Thats just the exams I woke up last\nnight and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I\nremembered wed done that one\n\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have anything to do\nwith work though He watched an owl flutter toward the school across\nthe bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth Hagrid was the only\none who ever sent him letters Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore\nHagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy never but   \n\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet\n\nWherere you going said Ron sleepily\n\nIve just thought of something said Harry He had turned white\nWeve got to go and see Hagrid now\n\nWhy panted Hermione hurrying to keep up\n\nDont you think its a bit odd said Harry scrambling up the grassy\nslope that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and\na stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket How\nmany people wander around with dragon eggs if its against wizard law\nLucky they found Hagrid dont you think Why didnt I see it before\n\nWhat are you talking about said Ron but Harry sprinting across the\ngrounds toward the forest didnt answer\n\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and\nsleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowl\n\nHullo he said smiling Finished yer exams Got time fer a drink\n\nYes please said Ron but Harry cut him off\n\nNo were in a hurry Hagrid Ive got to ask you something You know\nthat night you won Norbert What did the stranger you were playing cards\nwith look like\n\nDunno said Hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak off\n\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows\n\nIts not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in the Hogs Head   \nthats the pub down in the village Mighta bin a dragon dealer mightn\nhe I never saw his face he kept his hood up\n\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas What did you talk to him\nabout Hagrid Did you mention Hogwarts at all\n\nMighta come up said Hagrid frowning as he tried to remember\nYeah he asked what I did an I told him I was gamekeeper here\nHe asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after so I told\nhim an I said what Id always really wanted was a dragon an\nthen I can remember too well cause he kept buyin me drinks\nLets see yeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play\ncards fer it if I wanted but he had ter be sure I could handle it he\ndidn want it ter go ter any old home So I told him after Fluffy a\ndragon would be easy\n\nAnd did he    did he seem interested in Fluffy Harry asked try ing\nto keep his voice calm\n\nWell    yeah    how many three headed dogs dyeh meet even around\nHogwarts So I told him Fluffys a piece o cake if yeh know how to\ncalm him down jus play him a bit o music an hell go straight off\nter sleep   \n\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified\n\nI shouldnta told yeh that he blurted out Forget I said it Hey   \nwherere yeh goin\n\nHarry Ron and Hermione didnt speak to each other at all until they\ncame to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy\nafter the grounds\n\nWeve got to go to Dumbledore said Harry Hagrid told that stranger\nhow to get past Fluffy and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that\ncloak    it mustve been easy once hed got Hagrid drunk I just hope\nDumbledore believes us Firenze might back us up if Bane doesnt stop\nhim Wheres Dumbledores office\n\nThey looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the\nright direction They had never been told where Dumbledore lived nor\ndid they know anyone who had been sent to see him\n\nWell just have to    Harry began but a voice suddenly rang across\nthe hall\n\nWhat are you three doing inside\n\nIt was Professor McGonagall carrying a large pile of books\n\nWe want to see Professor Dumbledore said Hermione rather bravely\nHarry and Ron thought\n\nSee Professor Dumbledore Professor McGonagall repeated as though\nthis was a very fishy thing to want to do Why\n\nHarry swallowed    now what\n\nIts sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadnt because\nProfessor McGonagalls nostrils flared\n\nProfessor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly He\nreceived an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for\nLondon at once\n\nHes gone said Harry frantically Now\n\nProfessor Dumbledore is a very great wizard Potter he has many\ndemands on his time   \n\nBut this is important\n\nSomething you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic\nPotter\n\nLook said Harry throwing caution to the winds Professor    its\nabout the Sorcerers tone   \n\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected it wasnt that The books\nshe was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didnt pick them up\nHow do you know    she spluttered\n\nProfessor I think    I know    that Sn  that someones going to try\nand steal the Stone Ive got to talk to Professor Dumbledore\n\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion\n\nProfessor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally I dont\nknow how you found out about the Stone but rest assured no one can\npossibly steal it its too well protected\n\nBut Professor   \n\nPotter I know what Im talking about she said shortly She bent down\nand gathered up the fallen books I suggest you all go back outside and\nenjoy the sunshine\n\nBut they didnt\n\nIts tonight said Harry once he was sure Professor McGonagall was\nout of earshot Snapes going through the trapdoor tonight Hes found\nout everything he needs and now hes got Dumbledore out of the way He\nsent that note I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when\nDumbledore turns up\n\nBut what can we   \n\nHermione gasped Harry and Ron wheeled round\n\nSnape was standing there\n\nGood afternoon he said smoothly\n\nThey stared at him\n\nYou shouldnt be inside on a day like this he said with an odd\ntwisted smile\n\nWe were    Harry began without any idea what he was going to say\n\nYou want to be more careful said Snape Hanging around\n\nlike this people will think youre up to something And Gryffindor\nreally cant afford to lose any more points can it\n\nHarry flushed They turned to go outside but Snape called them back\n\nBe warned Potter    any more nighttime wanderings and I will\npersonally make sure you are expelled Good day to you\n\nHe strode off in the direction of the staffroom\n\nOut on the stone steps Harry turned to the others\n\nRight heres what weve got to do he whispered urgently One of us\nhas got to keep an eye on Snape    wait outside the staff room and\nfollow him if he leaves it Hermione youd better do that\n\nWhy me\n\nIts obvious said Ron You can pretend to be waiting for Professor\nFlitwick you know He put on a high voice Oh Professor Flitwick\nIm so worried I think I got question fourteen b wrong\n\nOh shut up said Hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for\nSnape\n\nAnd wed better stay outside the third floor corridor Harry told Ron\nCome on\n\nBut that part of the plan didnt work No sooner had they reached the\ndoor separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor\nMcGonagall turned up again and this time she lost her temper\n\nI suppose you think youre harder to get past than a pack of\nenchantments she stormed Enough of this nonsense If I hear you ve\ncome anywhere near here again Ill take another fifty points from\nGryffindor Yes Weasley from my own house Harry and Ron went back to\nthe common room Harry had just said At least Hermiones on Snapes\ntail when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came\nin\n\nIm sorry Harry she wailed Snape came out and asked me what I was\ndoing so I said I was waiting for Flitwick and Snape went to get him\nand Ive only just got away I dont know where Snape went\n\nWell thats it then isnt it Harry said\n\nThe other two stared at him He was pale and his eyes were glittering\n\nIm going out of here tonight and Im going to try and get to the Stone\nfirst\n\nYoure mad said Ron\n\nYou cant said Hermione After what McGonagall and Snape have said\nYoull be expelled\n\nSO WHAP Harry shouted Dont you understand If Snape gets hold of\nthe Stone Voldemorts coming back Havent you heard what it was like\nwhen he was trying to take over There wont be any Hogwarts to get\nexpelled from Hell flatten it or turn it into a school for the Dark\nArts Losing points doesnt matter anymore cant you see Dyou think\nhell leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house\ncup If I get caught before I can get to the Stone well Ill have to\ngo back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there its\nonly dying a bit later than I would have because Im never going over\nto the Dark Side Im going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing\nyou two say is going to stop me Voldemort killed my parents remember\n\nHe glared at them\n\nYoure right Harry said Hermione in a small voice\n\nIll use the invisibility cloak said Harry Its just lucky I got it\nback\n\nBut will it cover all three of us said Ron\n\nAll    all three of us\n\nOh come off it you dont think wed let you go alone\n\nOf course not said Hermione briskly How do you think youd get to\nthe Stone without us Id better go and took through my books there\nmight be something useful\n\nBut if we get caught you two will be expelled too\n\nNot if I can help it said Hermione grimly Flitwick told me in\nsecret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam Theyre not\nthrowing me out after that\n\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room\nNobody bothered them none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to\nHarry any more after all This was the first night he hadnt been upset\nby it Hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come\nacross one of the enchantments they were about to try to break Harry\nand Ron didnt talk much Both of them were thinking about what they\nwere about to do\n\nSlowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed\n\nBetter get the cloak Ron muttered as Lee Jordan finally left\nstretching and yawning Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory He\nputted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had\ngiven him for Christmas He pocketed it to use on Fluffy    he didnt\nfeel much like singing\n\nHe ran back down to the common room\n\nWed better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of\nus    if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own   \n\nWhat are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room Neville\nappeared from behind an armchair clutching Trevor the toad who looked\nas though hed been making another bid for freedom\n\nNothing Neville nothing said Harry hurriedly putting the cloak\nbehind his back\n\nNeville stared at their guilty faces\n\nYoure going out again he said\n\nNo no no said Hermione No were not Why dont you go to bed\nNeville\n\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door They couldnt afford\nto waste any more time Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep\n\nYou cant go out said Neville youll be caught again Gryffindor\nwill be in even more trouble\n\nYou dont understand said Harry this is important\n\nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate\n\nI wont let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the\nportrait hole Ill    Ill fight you\n\nNeville Ron exploded get away from that hole and dont be an idiot\n  \n\nDont you call me an idiot said Neville I dont think you should be\nbreaking any more rules And you were the one who told me to stand up to\npeople\n\nYes but not to us said Ron in exasperation Neville you dont know\nwhat youre doing\n\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad who leapt\nout of sight\n\nGo on then try and hit me said Neville raising his fists Im\nready\n\nHarry turned to Hermione\n\nDo something he said desperately\n\nHermione stepped forward\n\nNeville she said Im really really sorry about this\n\nShe raised her wand\n\nPetrificus Totalus she cried pointing it at Neville\n\nNevilles arms snapped to his sides His legs sprang together His whole\nbody rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face\nstiff as a board\n\nHermione ran to turn him over Nevilles jaws were jammed together so he\ncouldnt speak Only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror\n\nWhatve you done to him Harry whispered\n\nIts the full Body Bind said Hermione miserably Oh Neville Im so\nsorry\n\nWe had to Neville no time to explain said Harry\n\nYoull understand later Neville said Ron as they stepped over him\nand pulled on the invisibility cloak\n\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didnt feel like a\nvery good omen In their nervous state every statues shadow looked\nlike Filch every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping\ndown on them At the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted Mrs\nNorris skulking near the top\n\nOh lets kick her just this once Ron whispered in Harrys ear but\nHarry shook his head As they climbed carefully around her Mrs Norris\nturned her lamplike eyes on them but didnt do anything\n\nThey didnt meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the\nthird floor Peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that\npeople would trip\n\nWhos there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him He narrowed\nhis wicked black eyes Know youre there even if I cant see you Are\nyou ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie\n\nHe rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them\n\nShould call Filch I should if somethings a creeping around unseen\n\nHarry had a sudden idea\n\nPeeves he said in a hoarse whisper the Bloody Baron has his own\nreasons for being invisible\n\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock He caught himself in time\nand hovered about a foot off the stairs\n\nSo sorry your bloodiness Mr Baron Sir he said greasily My\nmistake my mistake    I didnt see you    of course I didnt youre\ninvisible    forgive old Peevsie his little joke sir\n\nI have business here Peeves croaked Harry Stay away from this\nplace tonight\n\nI will sir I most certainly will said Peeves rising up in the air\nagain Hope your business goes well Baron Ill not bother you\n\nAnd he scooted off\n\nBrilliant Harry whispered Ron\n\nA few seconds later they were there outside the third floor corridor\n   and the door was already ajar\n\nWell there you are Harry said quietly Snapes already got past\nFluffy\n\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them\nwhat was facing them Underneath the cloak Harry turned to the other\ntwo\n\nIf you want to go back I wont blame you he said You can take the\ncloak I wont need it now\n\nDont be stupid said Ron\n\nWere coming said Hermione\n\nHarry pushed the door open\n\nAs the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears All three of\nthe dogs noses sniffed madly in their direction even though it\ncouldnt see them\n\nWhats that at its feet Hermione whispered\n\nLooks like a harp said Ron Snape must have left it there\n\nIt must wake up the moment you stop playing said Harry Well here\ngoes\n\nHe put Hagrids flute to his lips and blew It wasnt really a tune but\nfrom the first note the beasts eyes began to droop Harry hardly drew\nbreath Slowly the dogs growls ceased    it tottered on its paws and\nfell to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast asleep\n\nKeep playing Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and\ncrept toward the trapdoor They could feel the dogs hot smelly breath\nas they approached the giant heads I think well be able to pull the\ndoor open said Ron peering over the dogs back Want to go first\nHermione\n\nNo I dont\n\nAll right Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dogs\nlegs He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and\nopen\n\nWhat can you see Hermione said anxiously\n\nNothing    just black    theres no way of climbing down well just\nhave to drop\n\nHarry who was still playing the flute waved at Ron to get his\nattention and pointed at himself\n\nYou want to go first Are you sure said Ron I dont know how deep\nthis thing goes Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep\n\nHarry handed the flute over In the few seconds silence the dog\ngrowled and twitched but the moment Hermione began to play it fell\nback into its deep sleep\n\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor There was no\nsign of the bottom\n\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\nfingertips Then he looked up at Ron and said If anything happens to\nme dont follow Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\nDumbledore right\n\nRight said Ron\n\nSee you in a minute I hope\n\nAnd Harry let go Cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down\ndown and    FLUMP With a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on\nsomething soft He sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the\ngloom It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant\n\nIts okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp\nwhich was the open trapdoor its a soft landing you can jump\n\nRon followed right away He landed sprawled next to Harry\n\nWhats this stuff were his first words\n\nDunno some sort of plant thing I suppose its here to break the fall\nCome on Hermione\n\nThe distant music stopped There was a loud bark from the dog but\nHermione had already jumped She landed on Harrys other side\n\nWe must be miles under the school  she said\n\nLucky this plant things here really said Ron\n\nLucky shrieked Hermione Look at you both\n\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall She had to struggle\nbecause the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist\nsnakelike tendrils around her ankles As for Harry and Ron their legs\nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing\n\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\nher Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant\noff them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster\nthe plant wound around them\n\nStop moving Hermione ordered them I know what this is    its\nDevils Snare\n\nOh Im so glad we know what its called thats a great help snarled\nRon leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his\nneck Shut up Im trying to remember how to kill it said Hermione\n\nWell hurry up I cant breathe Harry gasped wrestling with it as it\ncurled around his chest\n\nDevils Snare Devils Snare what did Professor Sprout say    it\nlikes the dark and the damp\n\nSo light a fire Harry choked\n\nYes    of course    but theres no wood Hermione cried wringing her\nhands\n\nHAVE YOU GONE MAD Ron bellowed ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT\n\nOh right said Hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it\nmuttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had\nused on Snape at the plant In a matter of seconds the two boys felt it\nloosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth\nWriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they\nwere able to pull free\n\nLucky you pay attention in Herbology Hermione said Harry as he\njoined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face\n\nYeah said Ron and lucky Harry doesnt lose his head in a crisis   \ntheres no wood honestly\n\nThis way said Harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the\nonly way forward\n\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of\nwater trickling down the walls The passageway sloped downward and\nHarry was reminded of Gringotts With an unpleasant jolt of the heart\nhe remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards\nbank If they met a dragon a fully grown dragon    Norbert had been bad\nenough\n\nCan you hear something Ron whispered\n\nHarry listened A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up\nahead\n\nDo you think its a ghost\n\nI dont know sounds like wings to me\n\nTheres light ahead    I can see something moving\n\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly\nlit chamber its ceiling arching high above them It was full of small\njewel bright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room On the\nopposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door\n\nDo you think theyll attack us if we cross the room said Ron\n\nProbably said Harry They dont look very vicious but I suppose if\nthey all swooped down at once well theres no other choice Ill\nrun\n\nHe took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted\nacross the room He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at\nhim any second but nothing happened He reached the door untouched He\npulled the handle but it was locked\n\nThe other two followed him They tugged and heaved at the door but it\nwouldnt budge not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm\n\nNow what said Ron\n\nThese birds they cant be here just for decoration said Hermione\n\nThey watched the birds soaring overhead glittering    glittering\n\nTheyre not birds Harry said suddenly Theyre keys Winged keys   \nlook carefully So that must mean he looked around the chamber while\nthe other two squinted up at the flock of keys  yes    look\nBroomsticks Weve got to catch the key to the door\n\nBut there are hundreds of them\n\nRon examined the lock on the door\n\nWere looking for a big old fashioned one    probably silver like the\nhandle\n\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into\nthe midst of the cloud of keys They grabbed and snatched but the\nbewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to\ncatch one\n\nNot for nothing though was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century He\nhad a knack for spotting things other people didnt After a minutes\nweaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he noticed a large\nsilver key that had a bent wing as if it had already been caught and\nstuffed roughly into the keyhole\n\nThat one he called to the others That big one    there    no there\n   with bright blue wings    the feathers are all crumpled on one side\n\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing crashed into\nthe ceiling and nearly fell off his broom\n\nWeve got to close in on it Harry called not taking his eyes off the\nkey with the damaged wing Ron you come at it from above    Hermione\nstay below and stop it from going down and Ill try and catch it Right\nNOW\n\nRon dived Hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and Harry\nstreaked after it it sped toward the wall Harry leaned forward and\nwith a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one\nhand Ron and Hermiones cheers echoed around the high chamber\n\nThey landed quickly and Harry ran to the door the key struggling in\nhis hand He rammed it into the lock and turned    it worked The moment\nthe lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very\nbattered now that it had been caught twice\n\nReady Harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle They\nnodded He pulled the door open\n\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldnt see anything at all But as\nthey stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an\nastonishing sight\n\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black\nchessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what\nlooked like black stone Facing them way across the chamber were the\nwhite pieces Harry Ron and Hermione shivered slightly    the towering\nwhite chessmen had no faces\n\nNow what do we do Harry whispered\n\nIts obvious isnt it said Ron Weve got to play our way across\nthe room\n\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door\n\nHow said Hermione nervously\n\nI think said Ron were going to have to be chessmen\n\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the\nknights horse At once the stone sprang to life The horse pawed the\nground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron\n\nDo we    er    have to join you to get across The black knight\nnodded Ron turned to the other two\n\nThis needs thinking about \the said I suppose weve got to take the\nplace of three of the black pieces\n\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet watching Ron think Finally he said\nNow dont be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at\nchess   \n\nWere not offended said Harry quickly Just tell us what to do\n\nWell Harry you take the place of that bishop and Hermione YOU 90\nnext to him instead of that castle\n\nWhat about you\n\nIm going to be a knight said Ron\n\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a\nknight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces\nand walked off the board leaving three empty squares that Harry Ron\nand Hermione took\n\nWhite always plays first in chess said Ron peering across the board\nYes look\n\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares\n\nRon started to direct the black pieces They moved silently wherever he\nsent them Harrys knees were trembling What if they lost\n\nHarry    move diagonally four squares to the right\n\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken The white\nqueen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he\nlay quite still facedown\n\nHad to let that happen said Ron looking shaken Leaves you free to\ntake that bishop Hermione go on\n\nEvery time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy\nSoon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall\nTwice Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in\ndanger He himself darted around the board taking almost as many white\npieces as they had lost black ones\n\nWere nearly there he muttered suddenly Let me think let me\nthink\n\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him\n\nYes said Ron softly Its the only way Ive got to be taken\n\nNOF Harry and Hermione shouted\n\nThats chess snapped Ron Youve got to make some sacrifices I take\none step forward and shell take me    that leaves you free to checkmate\nthe king Harry\n\nBut   \n\nDo you want to stop Snape or not\n\nRon   \n\nLook if you dont hurry up hell already have the Stone\n\nThere was no alternative\n\nReady Ron called his face pale but determined Here I go   now\ndont hang around once youve won\n\nHe stepped forward and the white queen pounced She struck Ron hard\nacross the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor  \nHermione screamed but stayed on her square   the white queen dragged Ron\nto one side He looked as if hed been knocked out\n\nShaking Harry moved three spaces to the left\n\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harrys feet They had\nwon The chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear With\none last desperate look back at Ron Harry and Hermione charged through\nthe door and up the next passageway\n\nWhat if hes   \n\nHell be all right said Harry trying to convince himself What do\nyou reckons next\n\nWeve had Sprouts that was the Devils Snare Flitwick mustve put\ncharms on the keys McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them\nalive that leaves Quirrells spell and Snapes\n\nThey had reached another door\n\nAll right Harry whispered\n\nGo on\n\nHarry pushed it open\n\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their\nrobes up over their noses Eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in\nfront of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out\ncold with a bloody lump on its head\n\nIm glad we didnt have to fight that one Harry whispered as they\nstepped carefully over one of its massive legs Come on I cant\nbreathe\n\nHe pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what\ncame next   but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table\nwith seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line\n\nSnapes said Harry What do we have to do\n\nThey stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind\nthem in the doorway It wasnt ordinary fire either it was purple At\nthe same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward\nThey were trapped\n\nLook Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles Harry\nlooked over her shoulder to read it\n\nDanger lies before you while safety lies behind\n\nTwo of us will help you which ever you would find\n\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead\n\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead\n\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine\n\nThree of us are killers waiting bidden in line\n\nChoose unless you wish to stay here forevermore\n\nTo help you in your choice we give you these clues four\n\nFirst however slyly the poison tries to hide\n\nYou will always find some on nettle wines left side\n\nSecond different are those who stand at either end\n\nBut if you would move onward neither is your friend\n\nThird as you see clearly all are different size\n\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides\n\nFourth the second left and the second on the right\n\nAre twins once you taste them though different at first sight\n\nHermione let out a great sigh and Harry amazed saw that she was\nsmiling the very last thing he felt like doing\n\nBrilliant said Hermione This isnt magic    its logic    a puzzle\nA lot of the greatest wizards havent got an ounce of logic theyd be\nstuck in here forever\n\nBut so will we wont we Of course not said Hermione Everything\nwe need is here on this paper Seven bottles three are poison two are\nwine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us\nback through the purple\n\nBut how do we know which to drink\n\nGive me a minute\n\nHermione read the paper several times Then she walked up and down the\nline of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them At last she\nclapped her hands\n\nGot it she said The smallest bottle will get us through the black\nfire    toward the Stone\n\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle\n\nTheres only enough there for one of us he said Thats hardly one\nswallow\n\nThey looked at each other\n\nWhich one will get you back through the purple flames\n\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line\n\nYou drink that said Harry No listen get back and get Ron Grab\nbrooms from the flying  key room theyll get you out of the trapdoor\nand past Fluffy    go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\nDumbledore we need him I might be able to hold Snape off for a while\nbut Im no match for him really\n\nBut Harry    what if You Know Whos with him\n\nWell    I was lucky once wasnt I said Harry pointing at his scar\nI might get lucky again\n\nHermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her\narms around him\n\nHermione\n\nHarry    youre a great wizard you know\n\nIm not as good as you said Harry very embarrassed as she let go of\nhim\n\nMe said Hermione Books And cleverness There are more important\nthings    friendship and bravery and    oh Harry    be careful\n\nYou drink first said Harry You are sure which is which arent\nyou\n\nPositive said Hermione She took a long drink from the round bottle\nat the end and shuddered\n\nIts not poison said Harry anxiously\n\nNo    but its like ice\n\nQuick go before it wears off\n\nGood luck    take care\n\nGO\n\nHermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire\n\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle He turned to\nface the black flames\n\nHere I come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp\n\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body He put the bottle\ndown and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flames licking\nhis body but couldnt feel them    for a moment he could see nothing\nbut dark fire    then he was on the other side in the last chamber\n\nThere was already someone there    but it wasnt Snape It wasnt even\nVoldemort\n\n\n",
    " SEVENTEEN\n\nTHE MAN WITH TWO FACES\n\nIt was Quirrell\n\nYou gasped Harry\n\nQuirrell smiled His face wasnt twitching at all\n\nMe he said calmly I wondered whether Id be meeting you here\nPotter\n\nBut I thought    Snape   \n\nSeverus Quirrell laughed and it wasnt his usual quivering treble\neither but cold and sharp Yes Severus does seem the type doesnt\nhe So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat Next to\nhim who would suspect p p poor st stuttering P Professor Quirrell\n\nHarry couldnt take it in This couldnt be true it couldnt\n\nBut Snape tried to kill me\n\nNo no no I tried to kill you Your friend Miss Granger accidentally\nknocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch\nmatch She broke my eye contact with you Another few seconds and Id\nhave got you off that broom Id have managed it before then if Snape\nhadnt been muttering a countercurse trying to save you\n\nSnape was trying to save me\n\nOf course said Quirrell coolly Why do you think he wanted to\nreferee your next match He was trying to make sure I didnt do it\nagain Funny really he neednt have bothered I couldnt do anything\nwith Dumbledore watching All the other teachers thought Snape was\ntrying to stop Gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular\nand what a waste of time when after all that Im going to kill you\ntonight\n\nQuirrell snapped his fingers Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped\nthemselves tightly around Harry\n\nYoure too nosy to live Potter Scurrying around the school on\nHalloween like that for all I knew youd seen me coming to look at what\nwas guarding the Stone\n\nYou let the troll in\n\nCertainly I have a special gift with trolls    you must have seen what\nI did to the one in the chamber back there Unfortunately while\neveryone else was running around looking for it Snape who already\nsuspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off    and not\nonly did my troll fail to beat you to death that three headed dog\ndidnt even manage to bite Snapes leg off properly\n\nNow wait quietly Potter I need to examine this interesting mirror\n\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell\nIt was the Mirror of Erised\n\nThis mirror is the key to finding the Stone Quirrell murmured\ntapping his way around the frame Trust Dumbledore to come up with\nsomething like this but hes in London Ill be far away by the\ntime he gets back\n\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him\nfrom concentrating on the mirror\n\nI saw you and Snape in the forest    he blurted out\n\nYes said Quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the\nback He was on to me by that time trying to find out how far Id got\nHe suspected me all along Tried to frighten me   as though he could\nwhen I had Lord Voldemort on my side\n\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into\nit\n\nI see the Stone Im presenting it to my master but where is it\n\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him but they didnt give He\nhad to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror\n\nBut Snape always seemed to hate me so much\n\nOh he does said Quirrell casually heavens yes He was at Hogwarts\nwith your father didnt you know They loathed each other But he never\nwanted you dead\n\nBut I heard you a few days ago sobbing    I thought Snape was\nthreatening you\n\nFor the first time a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrells face\n\nSometimes he said I find it hard to follow my masters instructions\n   he is a great wizard and I am weak   \n\nYou mean he was there in the classroom with you Harry gasped\n\nHe is with me wherever I go said Quirrell quietly I met him when I\ntraveled around the world A foolish young man I was then full of\nridiculous ideas about good and evil Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong\nI was There is no good and evil there is only power and those too\nweak to seek it Since then I have served him faithfully although I\nhave let him down many times He has had to be very hard on me\nQuirrell shivered suddenly He does not forgive mistakes easily When I\nfailed to steal the stone from Gringotts he was most displeased He\npunished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me\n\nQuirrells voice trailed away Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon\nAlley  how could he have been so stupid Hed seen Quirrell there that\nvery day shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron\n\nQuirrell cursed under his breath\n\nI dont understand is the Stone inside the mirror Should I break\nit\n\nHarrys mind was racing\n\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment he\nthought is to find the Stone before Quirrell does So if I look in the\nmirror I should see myseff finding it    which means Ill see where\nits hidden But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what Im up\nto\n\nHe tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without\nQuirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he\ntripped and fell over Quirrell ignored him He was still talking to\nhimself What does this mirror do How does it work Help me Master\n\nAnd to Harrys horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come\nfrom Quirrell himself\n\nUse the boy Use the boy\n\nQuirrell rounded on Harry\n\nYes    Potter    come here\n\nHe clapped his hands once and the ropes binding Harry fell off Harry\ngot slowly to his feet\n\nCome here Quirrell repeated Look in the mirror and tell me what you\nsee\n\nHarry walked toward him\n\nI must lie he thought desperately I must look and lie about what I\nsee thats all\n\nQuirrell moved close behind him Harry breathed in the funny smell that\nseemed to come from Quirrells turban He closed his eyes stepped in\nfront of the mirror and opened them again\n\nHe saw his reflection pale and scared looking at first But a moment\nlater the reflection smiled at him It put its hand into its pocket and\npulled out a blood red stone It winked and put the Stone back in its\npocket    and as it did so Harry felt something heavy drop into his\nreal pocket Somehow    incredibly    hed gotten the Stone\n\nWell said Quirrell impatiently What do you see\n\nHarry screwed up his courage\n\nI see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore he invented I    Ive\nwon the house cup for Gryffindor\n\nQuirrell cursed again\n\nGet out of the way he said As Harry moved aside he felt the\nSorcerers Stone against his leg Dare he make a break for it\n\nBut he hadnt walked five paces before a high voice spoke though\nQuirrell wasnt moving his lips\n\nHe lies He lies\n\nPotter come back here Quirrell shouted Tell me the truth What did\nyou just see\n\nThe high voice spoke again\n\nLet me speak to him face to face\n\nMaster you are not strong enough\n\nI have strength enough for this\n\nHarry felt as if Devils Snare was rooting him to the spot He couldnt\nmove a muscle Petrified he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to\nunwrap his turban What was going on The turban fell away Quirrells\nhead looked strangely small without it Then he turned slowly on the\nspot\n\nHarry would have screamed but he couldnt make a sound Where there\nshould have been a back to Quirrells head there was a face the most\nterrible face Harry had ever seen It was chalk white with glaring red\neyes and slits for nostrils like a snake\n\nHarry Potter it whispered\n\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldnt move\n\nSee what I have become the face said Mere shadow and vapor  I\nhave form only when I can share anothers body but there have always\nbeen those willing to let me into their hearts and minds Unicorn\nblood has strengthened me these past weeks you saw faithful Quirrell\ndrinking it for me in the forest and once I have the Elixir of Life\nI will be able to create a body of my own Now why dont you give\nme that Stone in your pocket\n\nSo he knew The feeling suddenly surged back into Harrys legs He\nstumbled backward\n\nDont be a fool snarled the face Better save your own life and join\nme or youll meet the same end as your parents They died begging\nme for mercy\n\nLIAR Harry shouted suddenly\n\nQuirrell was walking backward at him so that Voldemort could still see\nhim The evil face was now smiling\n\nHow touching it hissed I always value bravery Yes boy your\nparents were brave I killed your father first and he put up a\ncourageous fight but your mother neednt have died she was trying\nto protect you Now give me the Stone unless you want her to have\ndied in vain\n\nNEVER\n\nHarry sprang toward the flame door but Voldemort screamed SEIZE HIM\nand the next second Harry felt Quirrells hand close on his wrist At\nonce a needle sharp pain seared across Harrys scar his head felt as\nthough it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his\nmight and to his surprise Quirrell let go of him The pain in his head\nlessened    he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone and\nsaw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers    they were blistering\nbefore his eyes\n\nSeize him SEIZE HIM shrieked Voldemort again and Quirrell lunged\nknocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands\naround Harrys neck    Harrys scar was almost blinding him with pain\nyet he could see Quirrell howling in agony\n\nMaster I cannot hold him    my hands    my hands\n\nAnd Quirrell though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees let go\nof his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms    Harry could see\nthey looked burned raw red and shiny\n\nThen kill him fool and be done screeched Voldemort\n\nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but Harry by\ninstinct reached up and grabbed Quirrells face   \n\nAAAARGH\n\nQuirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then Harry knew\nQuirrell couldnt touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible\npain    his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell keep him in enough\npain to stop him from doing a curse\n\nHarry jumped to his feet caught Quirrell by the arm and hung on as\ntight as he could Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off    the\npain in Harrys head was building    he couldnt see    he could only\nhear Quirrells terrible shrieks and Voldemorts yells of KILL HIM\nKILL HIM and other voices maybe in Harrys own head crying Harry\nHarry\n\nHe felt Quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and\nfell into blackness down  down down\n\nSomething gold was glinting just above him The Snitch He tried to\ncatch it but his arms were too heavy\n\nHe blinked It wasnt the Snitch at all It was a pair of glasses How\nstrange\n\nHe blinked again The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view\nabove him\n\nGood afternoon Harry said Dumbledore Harry stared at him Then he\nremembered Sir The Stone It was Quirrell Hes got the Stone Sir\nquick   \n\nCalm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said\nDumbledore Quirrell does not have the Stone\n\nThen who does Sir I   \n\nHarry please relax or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out\n\nHarry swallowed and looked around him He realized he must be in the\nhospital wing He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next\nto him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop\n\nTokens from your friends and admirers said Dumbledore beaming What\nhappened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a\ncomplete secret so naturally the whole school knows I believe your\nfriends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to\nsend you a toilet seat No doubt they thought it would amuse you Madam\nPomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated\nit\n\nHow long have I been in here\n\nThree days Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved\nyou have come round they have been extremely worried\n\nBut sit the Stone\n\nI see you are not to be distracted Very well the Stone Professor\nQuirrell did not manage to take it from you I arrived in time to\nprevent that although you were doing very well on your own I must say\n\nYou got there You got Hermiones owl\n\nWe must have crossed in midair No sooner had I reached London than it\nbecame clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just\nleft I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you\n\nIt was you\n\nI feared I might be too late\n\nYou nearly were I couldnt have kept him off the Stone much longer   \n\nNot the Stone boy you    the effort involved nearly killed you For\none terrible moment there I was afraid it had As for the Stone it has\nbeen destroyed\n\nDestroyed said Harry blankly But your friend    Nicolas Flamel   \n\nOh you know about Nicolas said Dumbledore sounding quite delighted\nYou did do the thing properly didnt you Well Nicolas and I have had\na little chat and agreed its all for the best\n\nBut that means he and his wife will die wont they\n\nThey have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then\nyes they will die\n\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harrys face\n\nTo one as young as you Im sure it seems incredible but to Nicolas\nand Perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long\nday After all to the well organized mind death is but the next great\nadventure You know the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing As\nmuch money and life as you could want The two things most human beings\nwould choose above all    the trouble is humans do have a knack of\nchoosing precisely those things that are worst for them Harry lay\nthere lost for words Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the\nceiling\n\nSir said Harry Ive been thinking sir    even if the Stones\ngone Vol  I mean You Know  Who   \n\nCall him Voldemort Harry Always use the proper name for things Fear\nof a name increases fear of the thing itself\n\nYes sir Well Voldemorts going to try other ways of coming back\nisnt he I mean he hasnt gone has he\n\nNo Harry he has not He is still out there somewhere perhaps looking\nfor another body to share not being truly alive he cannot be killed\nHe left Quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers\nas his enemies Nevertheless Harry while you may only have delayed his\nreturn to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to\nfight what seems a losing battle next time    and if he is delayed\nagain and again why he may never return to power\n\nHarry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt Then\nhe said Sir there are some other things Id like to know if you can\ntell me things I want to know the truth about\n\nThe truth Dumbledore sighed It is a beautiful and terrible thing\nand should therefore be treated with great caution However I shall\nanswer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to in which\ncase I beg youll forgive me I shall not of course lie\n\nWell Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried\nto stop him from killing me But why would he want to kill me in the\nfirst place\n\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time\n\nAlas the first thing you ask me I cannot tell you Not today Not\nnow You will know one day put it from your mind for now Harry\nWhen you are older I know you hate to hear this when you are\nready you will know\n\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue\n\nBut why couldnt Quirrell touch me\n\nYour mother died to save you If there is one thing Voldemort cannot\nunderstand it is love He didnt realize that love as powerful as your\nmothers for you leaves its own mark Not a scar no visible sign to\nhave been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone\nwill give us some protection forever It is in your very skin Quirrell\nfull of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with Voldemort\ncould not touch you for this reason It was agony to touch a person\nmarked by something so good\n\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill\nwhich gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet When he had found\nhis voice again Harry said And the invisibility cloak   do you know\nwho sent it to me\n\nAh   your father happened to leave it in my possession and I thought\nyou might like it Dumbledores eyes twinkled Useful things your\nfather used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food\nwhen he was here\n\nAnd theres something else\n\nFire away\n\nQuirrell said Snape   \n\nProfessor Snape Harry Yes him    Quirrell said he hates me because\nhe hated my father Is that true\n\nWell they did rather detest each other Not unlike yourself and Mr\nMalfoy And then your father did something Snape could never forgive\n\nWhat\n\nHe saved his life\n\nWhat\n\nYes said Dumbledore dreamily Funny the way peoples minds work\nisnt it Professor Snape couldnt bear being in your fathers debt\nI do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt\nthat would make him and your father even Then he could go back to\nhating your fathers memory in peace\n\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he\nstopped\n\nAnd sir theres one more thing\n\nJust the one\n\nHow did I get the Stone out of the mirror\n\nAh now Im glad you asked me that It was one of my more brilliant\nideas and between you and me thats saying something You see only\none who wanted to find the Stone    find it but not use it    would be\nable to get it otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or\ndrinking Elixir of Life My brain surprises even me sometimes Now\nenough questions I suggest you make a start on these sweets Ah Bettie\nBotts Every Flavor Beans I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come\nacross a vomitflavored one and since then Im afraid Ive rather lost\nmy liking for them    but I think Ill be safe with a nice toffee dont\nyou\n\nHe smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth Then he\nchoked and said Alas Ear wax\n\nMadam Pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strict\n\nJust five minutes Harry pleaded\n\nAbsolutely not\n\nYou let Professor Dumbledore in\n\nWell of course that was the headmaster quite different You need\nrest\n\nI am resting look lying down and everything Oh go on Madam\nPomfrey\n\nOh very well she said But five minutes only\n\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in\n\nHarry\n\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but Harry was\nglad she held herself in as his head was still very sore\n\nOh Harry we were sure you were going to    Dumbledore was so worried\n  \n\nThe whole schools talking about it said Ron What really happened\n\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more\nstrange and exciting than the wild rumors Harry told them everything\nQuirrell the mirror the Stone and Voldemort Ron and Hermione were a\nvery good audience they gasped in all the right places and when Harry\ntold them what was under Quirrells turban Hermione screamed out loud\n\nSo the Stones gone said Ron finally Flamels just going to die\n\nThats what I said but Dumbledore thinks that    what was it    to\nthe well organized mind death is but the next great adventure\n\nI always said he was off his rocker said Ron looking quite impressed\nat how crazy his hero was\n\nSo what happened to you two said Harry\n\nWell I got back all right said Hermione I brought Ron round   \nthat took a while    and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact\nDumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall    he already knew    he\njust said Harrys gone after him hasnt he and hurtled off to the\nthird floor\n\nDyou think he meant you to do it said Ron Sending you your\nfathers cloak and everything\n\nWell  Hermione exploded if he did    I mean to say thats terrible\n   you could have been killed\n\nNo it isnt said Harry thoughtfully Hes a funny man Dumbledore\nI think he sort of wanted to give me a chance I think he knows more or\nless everything that goes on here you know I reckon he had a pretty\ngood idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just\ntaught us enough to help I dont think it was an accident he let me\nfind out how the mirror worked Its almost like he thought I had the\nright to face Voldemort if I could\n\nYeah Dumbledores off his rocker all right said Ron proudly\nListen youve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow The\npoints are all in and Slytherin won of course    you missed the last\nQuidditch match we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you    but\nthe foodll be good\n\nAt that moment Madam Pomfrey bustled over\n\nYouve had nearly fifteen minutes now OUT she said firmly\n\nAfter a good nights sleep Harry felt nearly back to normal\n\nI want to go to the feast he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened\nhis many candy boxes I can cant I\n\nProfessor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go she said\nstiffily as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didnt realize\nhow risky feasts could be And you have another visitor\n\nOh good said Harry Who is it\n\nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke As usual when he was\nindoors Hagrid looked too big to be allowed He sat down next to Harry\ntook one look at him and burst into tears\n\nIts    all    my    ruddy    fault he sobbed his face in his hands\nI told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy I told him It was the only\nthing he didnt know an I told him Yeh couldve died All fer a\ndragon egg Ill never drink again I should be chucked out an made ter\nlive as a Muggle\n\nHagrid said Harry shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and\nremorse great tears leaking down into his beard Hagrid hed have\nfound out somehow this is Voldemort were talking about hed have\nfound out even if you hadnt told him\n\nYeh couldve died sobbed Hagrid An don say the name\n\nVOLDEMORT Harry bellowed and Hagrid was so shocked he stopped\ncrying Ive met him and Im calling him by his name Please cheer up\nHagrid we saved the Stone its gone he cant use it Have a Chocolate\nFrog Ive got loads\n\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said That reminds\nme Ive got yeh a present\n\nIts not a stoat sandwich is it said Harry anxiously and at last\nHagrid gave a weak chuckle Nah Dumbledore gave me the day off\nyesterday ter fix it Course he shoulda sacked me instead    anyway\ngot yeh this\n\nIt seemed to be a handsome leather covered book Harry opened it\ncuriously It was full of wizard photographs Smiling and waving at him\nfrom every page were his mother and father\n\nSent owls off ter all yer parents old school friends askin fer\nphotos knew yeh didn have any dyeh like it\n\nHarry couldnt speak but Hagrid understood\n\nHarry made his way down to the end of year feast alone that night He\nhad been held up by Madam Pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving\nhim one last checkup so the Great Hall was already full It was decked\nout in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherins\nwinning the house cup for the seventh year in a row A huge banner\nshowing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table\n\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush and then everybody started\ntalking loudly at once He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione\nat the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were\nstanding up to look at him\n\nFortunately Dumbledore arrived moments later The babble died away\n\nAnother year gone Dumbledore said cheerfully And I must trouble you\nwith an old mans wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our\ndelicious feast What a year it has been Hopefully your heads are all a\nlittle fuller than they were you have the whole summer ahead to get\nthem nice and empty before next year starts\n\nNow as I understand it the house cup here needs awarding and the\npoints stand thus In fourth place Gryffindor with three hundred and\ntwelve points in third Hufflepuff with three hundred and fifty two\nRavenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and Slytherin four hundred\nand seventy  two\n\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table\nHarry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table It was a\nsickening sight\n\nYes Yes well done Slytherin said Dumbledore However recent\nevents must be taken into account\n\nThe room went very still The Slytherins smiles faded a little\n\nAhem said Dumbledore I have a few last minute points to dish out\nLet me see Yes\n\nFirst    to Mr Ronald Weasley\n\nRon went purple in the face he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn\n\nfor the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years I\naward Gryffindor house fifty points\n\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling the stars\noverhead seemed to quiver Percy could be heard telling the other\nprefects My brother you know My youngest brother Got past\nMcGonagalls giant chess set\n\nAt last there was silence again\n\nSecond    to Miss Hermione Granger for the use of cool logic in the\nface of fire I award Gryffindor house fifty points\n\nHermione buried her face in her arms Harry strongly suspected she had\nburst into tears Gryffindors up and down the table were beside\nthemselves    they were a hundred points up Third    to Mr Harry\nPotter said Dumbledore The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve\nand outstanding courage I award Gryffindor house sixty points\n\nThe din was deafening Those who could add up while yelling themselves\nhoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy two points\n   exactly the same as Slytherin They had tied for the house cup    if\nonly Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point\n\nDumbledore raised his hand The room gradually fell silent\n\nThere are all kinds of courage said Dumbledore smiling It takes a\ngreat deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies but just as much to\nstand up to our friends I therefore award ten points to Mr Neville\nLongbottom\n\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some\nsort of explosion had taken place so loud was the noise that erupted\nfrom the Gryffindor table Harry Ron and Hermione stood up to yell and\ncheer as Neville white with shock disappeared under a pile of people\nhugging him He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before\nHarry still cheering nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy who\ncouldnt have looked more stunned and horrified if hed just had the\nBody Bind Curse put on him\n\nWhich means Dumbledore called over the storm of applause for even\nRavenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin we\nneed a little change of decoration\n\nHe clapped his hands In an instant the green hangings became scarlet\nand the silver became gold the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a\ntowering Gryffindor lion took its place Snape was shaking Professor\nMcGonagalls hand with a horrible forced smile He caught Harrys eye\nand Harry knew at once that Snapes feelings toward him hadnt changed\none jot This didnt worry Harry It seemed as though life would be back\nto normal next year or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts\n\nIt was the best evening of Harrys life better than winning at\nQuidditch or Christmas or knocking out mountain trolls he would\nnever ever forget tonight\n\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come but\ncome they did To their great surprise both he and Ron passed with good\nmarks Hermione of course had the best grades of the first years Even\nNeville scraped through his good Herbology mark making up for his\nabysmal Potions one They had hoped that Goyle who was almost as stupid\nas he was mean might be thrown out but he had passed too It was a\nshame but as Ron said you couldnt have everything in life\n\nAnd suddenly their wardrobes were empty their trunks were packed\nNevilles toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets notes were\nhanded out to all students warning them not to use magic over the\nholidays I always hope theyll forget to give us these said Fred\nWeasley sadly Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats\nthat sailed across the lake they were boarding the Hogwarts Express\ntalking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier\neating Bettie Botts Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns\npulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats pulling\ninto platform nine and three quarters at Kings Cross Station\n\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform A wizened\nold guard was up by the ticket barrier letting them go through the gate\nin twos and threes so they didnt attract attention by all bursting out\nof a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles\n\nYou must come and stay this summer said Ron both of you    Ill\nsend you an owl\n\nThanks said Harry Ill need something to look forward to People\njostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle\nworld Some of them called\n\nBye Harry\n\nSee you Potter\n\nStill famous said Ron grinning at him\n\nNot where Im going I promise you said Harry\n\nHe Ron and Hermione passed through the gateway together There he is\nMom there he is look\n\nIt was Ginny Weasley Rons younger sister but she wasnt pointing at\nRon\n\nHarry Potter she squealed Look Mom I can see\n\nBe quiet Ginny and its rude to point\n\nMrs Weasley smiled down at them\n\nBusy year she said\n\nVery said Harry Thanks for the fudge and the sweater Mrs\nWeasley\n\nOh it was nothing dear\n\nReady are you\n\nIt was Uncle Vernon still purple faced still mustached still looking\nfurious at the nerve of Harry carrying an owl in a cage in a station\nfull of ordinary people Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley\nlooking terrified at the very sight of Harry\n\nYou must be Harrys family said Mrs Weasley\n\nIn a manner of speaking said Uncle Vernon Hurry up boy we havent\ngot all day He walked away\n\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione\n\nSee you over the summer then\n\nHope you have    er    a good holiday said Hermione looking\nuncertainly after Uncle Vernon shocked that anyone could be so\nunpleasant\n\nOh I will said Harry and they were surprised at the grin that was\nspreading over his face They dont know were not allowed to use magic\nat home Im going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer\n\nTHE END\n"
